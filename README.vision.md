# üß† MindMirror: Vision, Roadmap & Project Status

## 1. The Vision: Your Generative Performance Engine

MindMirror is a symbiotic system that fuses trusted, external wisdom with a user's own internal, subjective experience. It is not merely a tool, but a digital twin of the user's performance journey.

The ultimate goal is to create a **generative performance engine**. A user shouldn't just ask "What should I eat?"; they should be able to state a complex, multi-faceted goal in natural language and have the system generate a complete, actionable plan.

## 2. Personas We Serve

We are building for individuals who are proactive about their well-being but face common, complex challenges. Our target personas include:

*   **The Overwhelmed Beginner:** Knows they need to make a change but is paralyzed by information overload and a fear of getting it wrong. They need clear guidance, a low barrier to entry, and a plan that feels achievable.
    *   *"I've been running and lifting some weights for a while but don't really know what to do next. I like yoga a lot. Can you make me a 6-week program for getting started with strength? I'm scared of gyms though."*

*   **The Life-Constrained Optimizer:** Already has an established routine and goals but needs to adapt them to the messy reality of life‚Äîtravel, stress, lack of equipment, or fluctuating energy levels.
    *   *"I'm going on vacation for two weeks with no equipment. I'd like to keep working out to the same goals; can you update my plans?"*

*   **The Holistic Explorer:** Views their body and mind as a single system and is keen to experiment with different philosophies (e.g., Ayurveda, Stoicism, Paleo) to see how they impact mood, energy, and performance.
    *   *"I'm having trouble sleeping; I'm pretty sure it's my eating. Can you give me an Ayurvedic diet and adjust my yoga flows? I've been having lots of kapha energy."*

*   **The Habit Builder:** Feels "off track" and needs help building foundational habits to regain a sense of control and well-being, starting with small, atomic actions.
    *   *"I'm a fucking wreck lately. Give me 4 habits to build that will help me with sleep and eating a reasonable diet."*

## 3. Current Architecture: A Federated Microservices System

MindMirror is built as a distributed system of specialized microservices, orchestrated by a federated GraphQL gateway. This architecture enables independent scaling, development, and deployment of each domain.

### Production Services Currently Deployed

*   **Agent Service (Port 8000):** The AI reasoning engine with RAG capabilities, powered by LangChain and either OpenAI or Ollama. Handles semantic search, knowledge retrieval, and AI-powered responses.
*   **Journal Service (Port 8001):** Manages all journaling functionality including structured (Gratitude, Reflection) and freeform entries with automatic vector indexing.
*   **Hive Gateway (Port 4000):** GraphQL federation layer that unifies all microservices into a single API surface with JWT authentication and request routing.
*   **Next.js Web App (Port 3001):** Modern, responsive frontend with Apollo Client, authentication, and real-time updates.
*   **Streamlit UI (Port 8501):** Legacy interface for AI coaching and document management (transitioning to Next.js).

### Supporting Infrastructure

*   **PostgreSQL:** Primary relational database for all structured data
*   **Qdrant:** Vector database for semantic search over documents and journal entries
*   **Redis:** Message broker for Celery task queue
*   **Celery Workers:** Background processing for document indexing and AI tasks
*   **Flower (Port 5555):** Real-time monitoring of background tasks

## 5. üöß Known Issues & Technical Debt

### Frontend Issues

#### 1. Journal History Caching
**Priority:** Medium  
**Description:** When a new journal entry is submitted, the history page doesn't auto-update without manual refresh.  
**Root Cause:** Apollo Client cache not being invalidated after mutations.  
**Solution:** Add `refetchQueries` to mutation hooks for `GET_JOURNAL_ENTRIES`.

#### 2. Middleware Authentication Non-Functional
**Priority:** Low  
**Description:** The `middleware.ts` file exists but is not being executed by Next.js.  
**Location:** `/web/middleware.ts`  
**Impact:** Admin routes are unprotected, but admin functionality is not currently in use.  
**Solution:** Verify file placement and Next.js configuration.

### Backend & Infrastructure

#### 3. Ollama Environment Detection
**Priority:** Medium  
**Description:** Embedding service URL needs better environment detection for local vs Docker deployment.  
**Current State:** Hardcoded to `host.docker.internal:11434`  
**Solution:** Add dynamic URL resolution based on deployment context.

#### 4. Error Handling Standardization
**Priority:** Low  
**Description:** Inconsistent error handling patterns across microservices.  
**Solution:** Implement standardized error schemas and handling middleware.

### Documentation

#### 5. API Documentation Gaps
**Priority:** Low  
**Description:** GraphQL schema needs better field descriptions for frontend development.  
**Solution:** Add comprehensive `@doc` directives to all schema fields.

## 6. üöÄ Next Evolution: The AutoGen-Powered Agent Kernel

The next major evolution focuses on building a sophisticated agentic system using LangGraph for deterministic workflows and AutoGen for complex orchestration.

### Phase 1: LangGraph Foundation (In Progress)

**Objective:** Build reliable, testable workflows for core business domains using LangGraph's stateful computation graphs.

#### Core Concept: Dynamic Tool Discovery via GraphQL Introspection

1.  **Schema as Tool Registry:** Any `Query` or `Mutation` in the federated schema can become an agent tool.
2.  **`@agentTool` Directive:** Custom GraphQL directive to explicitly mark fields available to agents.
3.  **Introspection on Startup:** Agent service queries gateway to discover available tools dynamically.
4.  **Runtime Tool Generation:** Python functions generated in memory for each discovered GraphQL operation.

#### LangGraph Implementation Architecture

*   **State Object:** Central Pydantic model tracking user input, execution plan, tool results, and final response.
*   **Node Functions:** 
    *   `plan_step`: Analyzes user input and determines next tool to execute
    *   `execute_tool`: Calls dynamically generated GraphQL functions
    *   `synthesize_response`: Generates final user-facing answer
*   **Conditional Edges:** Route execution flow based on state (continue planning, execute tools, or finish)

### Phase 2: AutoGen Orchestrator (Future)

**Objective:** Layer AutoGen on top of LangGraph workflows for complex, multi-domain requests.

The AutoGen "CEO" agent will decompose complex requests like:
> *"Plan me a workout and nutrition program based on my goals, the fact I'm trying to go vegetarian, and am training for a marathon but happen to have a right shoulder impingement."*

Instead of calling GraphQL tools directly, AutoGen will orchestrate pre-built LangGraph workflows, providing emergent conversational intelligence while maintaining the reliability of deterministic core processes.

## 8. üîÆ Long-Term Vision: The Knowledge Graph Evolution

### Current Stack Evolution
Moving from the current **Postgres + Qdrant** foundation to **Postgres + Qdrant + Knowledge Graph** for deeper relationship modeling.

| Aspect | Current (Postgres + Qdrant) | Future (+ Knowledge Graph) |
|--------|-------------------------------|----------------------------|
| **Strength** | Best-of-breed services optimized for their purpose | Explicit relationship modeling as first-class citizen |
| **Query Pattern** | Two-step: Find in Postgres ‚Üí Search in Qdrant | Single graph traversal with rich relationship context |
| **Example** | "Find stoic advice for anxiety" *requires app orchestration* | "Find `(Advice)` connected to `(Stoic)` tradition and `(Concept:anxiety)` mentioned in recent `(Journal)` entries" |

### Implementation Strategy
1. **Maintain Current Foundation** - Postgres + Qdrant remains source of truth
2. **Add Graph Projection** - Project data into knowledge graph via CDC pipeline
3. **Hybrid Queries** - Combine vector search with graph traversal for deeper insights
