# Welcome to Better Knees

Welcome to your knee strengthening program! We're excited to help you build stronger, more resilient knees.

## Welcome

Starting this program is an important step toward better knee health. Whether you're dealing with discomfort, want to prevent future issues, or simply want stronger knees for daily activities, you're in the right place.

This program combines targeted exercises, mobility work, and evidence-based strategies to help you build the foundation for healthy, pain-free knees.

## Getting Started

This program is designed to help you:

1. **Strengthen key muscle groups** that support your knees (glutes, quadriceps, hamstrings, and calves)
2. **Improve mobility and flexibility** in your hips, knees, and ankles
3. **Reduce pain and discomfort** through targeted therapeutic exercises
4. **Build consistent habits** for long-term knee health and injury prevention

## Program Overview

Your Better Knees program includes:

- **Progressive strength training** focusing on the muscles that stabilize and support your knees
- **Mobility and flexibility routines** to improve range of motion and reduce stiffness
- **Functional movement patterns** that translate to better daily activities
- **Recovery and injury prevention strategies** you can use long-term

Each workout is carefully designed to:
- Start with proper warm-up and mobility
- Progress gradually in intensity and complexity
- Include modifications for different fitness levels
- End with targeted stretching and recovery

## Tips for Success

- **Start slow and focus on form**: Perfect movement patterns matter more than heavy weights or speed
- **Be consistent**: Small, regular efforts yield better results than sporadic intense sessions
- **Listen to your body**: Some muscle fatigue is normal, but sharp pain is not—stop if you feel pain
- **Track your progress**: Use the app to log your workouts and monitor improvements over time
- **Stay patient**: Building strength and mobility takes time—trust the process
- **Ask questions**: If you're unsure about any exercise or experience pain, reach out to your coach

Remember: everyone starts somewhere, and every rep counts toward your stronger future.

## What's Next?

Your program starts today! Check your daily tasks and begin with your first scheduled workout. Each session builds on the previous one, creating a progressive path toward stronger, healthier knees.

The exercises may feel challenging at first, but they're designed to meet you where you are and help you improve steadily. Focus on consistency over perfection—showing up regularly is what creates lasting change.
