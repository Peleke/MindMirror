You’ve just completed our 7-habit nutrition program — and that’s no small feat. Over the past days, you’ve been building a new foundation for eating that works with your body instead of against it. You’ve practiced awareness, patience, and balance — the very skills that transform eating from a mindless routine into an intentional, nourishing act.

Let’s take a moment to celebrate what you’ve mastered:

| **Habit** | **Description (Goal)** |
| --- | --- |
| **1. Put the Phone Down** | Eating without screens or distractions so you can truly experience your food and tune into your body’s signals. |
| **2. Eat Slowly (Chew Thoroughly)** | Taking smaller bites, chewing well, and pausing between bites to better notice fullness cues. |
| **3. Stop at 80% Full (Leave a Bite Leftover)** | Recognizing when you’re nearly satisfied and stopping before you overeat. |
| **4. Fiber first: Start with Vegetables**  | Front-loading your meal with a veggie-rich starter, high-fiber smart carb, filling half your plate with produce. |
| **5. Prioritize Protein** | Including enough protein along with fiber means better satiety and steadier energy. |
| **6. No Sugary Drinks** | Replacing soda, juice, or other sugar-heavy drinks with water or other low/no-calorie options. |
| **7. Favor Whole Foods** | Eating minimally processed foods and using herbs/spices to keep meals flavorful and nutrient-rich. |

### Why This Matters

Each of these habits is simple on its own, but together, they create a powerful system. You’re not “dieting.” You’re changing the *default settings* of how you eat. You’re reprogramming old habits into new ones that actually serve you — habits that require less willpower over time because they run automatically in the background of your life.

This is the opposite of restriction. Instead of focusing on what you *can’t* eat, you’ve learned to add in more of the foods and behaviors that make you feel good, energized, and in control. The best part? These habits are sustainable. They can travel with you — to restaurants, to work lunches, to family gatherings — without requiring a special plan or “being on a diet.”

### What’s Next

You’ve now got the foundation that underpins every health and nutrition goal worth chasing. Whether your next step is losing weight, gaining muscle, improving athletic performance, getting lean and toned, dialing in your diet for a specific sport, or simply eating in a way that feels good long-term—**these habits are the starting line for all of it.**

Why? Because no matter what direction you take, the fundamentals never change. Eating mindfully, prioritizing whole foods, balancing your plate, and nourishing your body with water, protein, and fiber create the baseline conditions for success in *any* program. From here, it’s just a matter of customizing the details to fit your goals.

So—what’s your next move?

Tell your friends, post it publicly, or even better—send it to us directly. The more you speak it into the world, the more real it becomes. This is how momentum starts.

### Your Turn to Inspire

The only thing better than making progress is helping someone else start their journey. If this program helped you eat better, feel better, or think differently about food, share it. Send a friend the link, post your success story, or invite someone to try the app when it launches.

This is how habits spread — not through willpower alone, but through community.

Here’s to your next chapter. You’ve built the foundation — now let’s keep building.

### P.S.: If this was helpful…

🚨 Shameless Plug 🚨

If you enjoyed the structure of this program, you’ll love how it feels inside the **Swae OS app**. It’s the same step-by-step approach you just experienced, but with built-in habit tracking, bite-sized lessons, reflection prompts, and progress logs — all in one place.

In the coming months, we’ll also be adding a **meal composition tracking feature** so you can log your meals without obsessing over calorie math — keeping the focus on quality and balance instead of numbers.

And if you want to take things further, keep an eye out for our **upcoming cooking and meal-prep programs**, plus advanced habit sequences to level up your nutrition and fitness — all available through the app.
