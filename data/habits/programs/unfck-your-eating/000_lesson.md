## Screens Off: Put the Phone (and TV) Down

*Because it’s hard to change behavior you don’t even notice.*

…You know how it goes: you sit down to eat “real quick,” phone in one hand, fork in the other. Maybe you’re scrolling, maybe you’re answering emails, maybe you’re rewatching *Schitt’s Creek* for the seventh time while eating ice cream straight from the pint. It feels like a break—but your brain is somewhere else, and your body doesn’t get the memo.

The result? You look down and realize the food’s gone, but somehow…you’re still hungry *and* weirdly overstuffed.

This habit sneaks up on us, but it’s one of the biggest culprits behind disconnected eating. **If your goal is to feel more calm and in control around food, it starts with showing up for your meals.**

Ask yourself: what are you *really* hungry for when you eat distracted?

---

### Evidence

Studies show that eating with attention yields significantly better appetite regulation. In fact, using a smartphone during meals has been shown to **increase caloric intake**—not just a little, but meaningfully—because distraction dulls hunger and fullness signals. Watching TV, responding to emails, even just *having a screen nearby* can all lead you to eat more food (and more *unhealthy* food) than when you’re focused on your plate.

But here’s the kicker: this isn’t just about eating *more*. It’s about eating food you **don’t even remember**. Calories you don’t *notice*, because you never actually tasted them.

You scroll for another two minutes, and suddenly the chips are gone—but you don’t even feel satisfied. This is how we wind up feeling out of control: not because our willpower failed, but because we *weren’t even there*.

Every distracted bite is a missed chance to reconnect with your own body. How many of your goals got sideswiped by “just one more reel”? I’ll bet it’s not just eating.

By contrast, eating without screens helps you slow down, chew properly, and *actually taste* your food. This sounds silly, but it’s real: **most of us under-chew**. We swallow large chunks whole. We eat fast, barely tasting the food. That’s a double-whammy: you overeat because your brain doesn’t register fullness fast enough—and your digestion suffers because your stomach has to do the work your teeth skipped.

Chewing well helps your body break food down more efficiently, and research suggests that it also improves nutrient absorption, lowers bloating, and makes meals more satisfying—all things that help curb the cycle of overeating and regret.

More importantly: this isn’t just physical. It’s emotional. You want to feel more calm around food? Present. Confident? In control? Then start by *showing up*. Undistracted meals give your brain the space to process what’s actually happening. You begin to recognize the difference between hunger, boredom, and stress. This habit may feel small, but it’s the hinge that swings the whole door. It reconnects your mind to your body—and that is what changes everything.

> Ayurveda has long emphasized the importance of calm, focused eating. One commonly cited teaching is: “When you eat, just eat. Do not eat while walking, talking, or watching TV.” Whether or not you follow Ayurveda, the wisdom is clear: food deserves attention—and so do you.
> 

Modern research agrees. Turning off distractions during meals is a form of **mindful eating**—and mindful eating is strongly associated with lower rates of bingeing, emotional eating, and weight cycling. It also improves **digestion** by activating the parasympathetic nervous system—your “rest-and-digest” mode.

Why does this matter? Because most of us spend our day in **fight-or-flight** mode. We’re stressed, overstimulated, and overwhelmed. Our nervous systems are stuck in high gear—and digestion literally shuts down in that state. When you pause, breathe, and eat without a screen, you help your body shift gears. You send a signal to your nervous system that it’s safe to relax, safe to receive nourishment.

And *that’s* when real healing happens: not just physically, but emotionally. Less anxiety. More calm. More presence. It’s all connected—and it starts here.

### **Pushback**

“Yeah, but…” is the soundtrack to every habit you’ve ever tried to build.

- *Yeah, but I’m too busy to just sit and eat.*
- *Yeah, but I use lunch to catch up on emails.*
- *Yeah, but I don’t even notice when I check my phone—it’s just…automatic.*

That’s exactly the point.

When you’ve been eating with one hand and scrolling with the other for years, you’re not *choosing* distraction—you’re *defaulting* to it. This week, we break the default.

You’ll be amazed what changes when your brain gets to focus on one thing at a time—especially something as primal and sensory as food.

### **Action Items: Ways to Practice This Habit**

Your only goal: *eat one meal without distraction, every day*. Notice what shifts.

Here’s one way to practice for each day of the week. You can do them all, repeat choose one, repeat your favorites, mix and match…It’s up to you, and long as you are **consistently** engage, **every day**.

- **Monday: Phone on silent.**
    
    Before you eat, mute notifications. Let this be your signal that for the next few minutes, the world can wait.
    
- **Tuesday: Phone off.**
    
    Yes, *off*. Power down completely. You’ll live.
    
- **Wednesday: Phone in another room.**
    
    Not face-down on the table. Not “just out of reach.” Out of sight, out of mind—literally.
    
- **Thursday: Ten-minute timer.**
    
    Before your first bite, set a timer. No screens until it dings. Think you can’t make it? Great. Prove yourself wrong tomorrow.
    
- **Friday: The “first bite” method.**
    
    Take your first bite like it’s a wine tasting: slow, curious, detailed. Chew until the texture is gone. Notice flavor, temperature, and how your body responds.
    
- **Saturday: Meal in silence.**
    
    No podcasts, no music, no talking—just you, the food, and your thoughts. Watch the discomfort, then the calm.
    

Remember: The seventh day is your **Reflection Meal**. No special tactics, no extra rules—just be present while you eat, and practice your habit. Afterwards, take one minute to jot down what you noticed.

---

### **Accountability: Reflect, Record, Repeat**

Remember: **Public commitment can double your follow-through.** 

If you want to go next level: share one daily reflection with someone—*anyone—*even if it’s just a sentence. A single thought you had as you practiced—even if just, *that sucked*.

Here are some questions to consider. Don’t keep your answers a secret. Tell a friend, partner, or group chat how you feel—or post about it. Tag us if you do.

| **Day** | **Prompt** |
| --- | --- |
| **Monday** | What was the first urge to check my phone? Did it fade or grow stronger? |
| **Tuesday** | How did it feel to fully shut my phone down before eating? |
| **Wednesday** | Did removing my phone entirely change the way I paid attention to my food? |
| **Thursday** | How long before you looked at how much time was left?…Be honest. How long *felt* like ten minutes? |
| **Friday** | What flavors or textures did I notice that I usually miss? |
| **Saturday** | Was eating in silence uncomfortable, calming, or both? |
| **Sunday** | What did I learn about myself this week? Did I eat more, less, or just differently? |

### **Final Notes**

You might think of this as a small habit—just a few minutes without your phone—but in practice, it’s a **massive shift** in how you relate to food. When you strip away the noise, you give yourself a rare chance to be *with* the meal, not just *near* it. That’s how you start noticing the little details: a flavor you didn’t realize you loved, a portion that felt “just right,” or the fact that you were satisfied long before your plate was empty.

The real win isn’t eating “better” overnight—it’s breaking the autopilot loop. Each undistracted meal is a rep in training your attention. Keep stacking those reps and soon, eating with presence will feel as natural as checking your phone used to. Except this time, you’ll actually walk away full—in every sense of the word.
