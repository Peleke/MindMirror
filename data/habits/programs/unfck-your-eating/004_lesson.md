Let’s be honest: you’re probably eating less protein than you think.

Most people do—especially if they’re trying to “eat lighter.” A latte here, a salad there, a bar for lunch, and then…a snack attack at 4pm so intense it feels like your body’s trying to stage a mutiny.

That’s not a willpower problem. That’s a protein problem.

Protein is your body’s “calm the f*ck down” signal. It slows digestion, regulates blood sugar, keeps you full, and helps you think—not just react. When you don’t get enough, your brain and body go into panic mode: give me food, any food, right now. That panic drives the very cycles you’re here to unf*ck—chaotic snacking, overeating at night, guilt after meals, and the sneaky return of old binge patterns.

So this week? We’re bringing protein back.

A palm-sized portion (about an inch thick) at every meal—think eggs, fish, poultry, tofu, beans, lentils, or Greek yogurt. If you're more active or trying to gain muscle? Make it two palms.

> Soft reminder: You probably didn’t join this because you wanted to track grams. You joined because you want to stop fighting with food—and feel steady. Protein is how we get there.

### **Evidence**

Protein isn’t just about muscles—it’s about *regulation*. In randomized trials, meals higher in protein significantly reduce ghrelin (the hunger hormone) and increase peptide YY and GLP-1, which boost satiety and help you naturally reduce calorie intake without thinking about it.¹

One review in the *American Journal of Clinical Nutrition* found that participants eating higher-protein meals had better appetite control, ate fewer snacks, and experienced fewer cravings—especially late in the day.²

It’s also the macronutrient most tied to *behavioral stability*. A study from the University of Missouri showed that eating 30+ grams of protein at breakfast led to improved cognitive performance, reduced impulsive food decisions, and a 60% reduction in late-night snacking.³ Think about that: changing *one* meal can change your brain’s ability to make better choices *later in the day*—no journaling or hacks required.

And here’s where things get even more powerful: protein + fiber = **appetite regulation magic**. When you pair a palm of protein with a fist of veggies or fiber-rich carbs (like beans or oats), the combined effect stabilizes your blood sugar for 3–4 hours. That means fewer crashes, fewer cravings, and way more mental energy to focus on *literally anything else* besides what’s in the pantry.

### Sources of Protein

Below are some common sources of protein, split into animal and plant sources.

**Animal-Based**

Animal-based sources of protein have many advantages, because they are

- Dense, meaning you don’t have to eat much to get significant amounts of protein
- Complete, meaning they contain all amino acids your body needs
- Bioavailable, meaning the protein they contain is easy for your body to break down and use quickly

However, many animal proteins are also significant sources of saturated fat and cholesterol, so be mindful of your portions and, in general, prefer leaner cuts. 

| Food Name | Easy Prep Suggestions |
| --- | --- |
| Eggs | Boil, scramble, fry, or bake into muffins |
| Greek Yogurt (plain) | Eat alone, add fruit, or blend into smoothies |
| Cottage Cheese | Eat plain, with fruit, or spread on toast |
| Chicken Breast | Grill, bake, or pan-sear in bulk for the week |
| Turkey Breast | Slice for sandwiches or wraps |
| Salmon (fresh or canned) | Grill, bake, or mix canned with Greek yogurt for spread |
| Tuna (canned) | Mix with mustard or Greek yogurt; serve on crackers |
| Sardines (canned) | Eat from tin, on toast, or in salads |
| Shrimp | Boil or sauté quickly from frozen |
| Lean Beef | Pan-cook patties, strips, or ground for various dishes |

**Plant-Based**

Animal-based sources of protein have many advantages, because they are

- Dense, meaning you don’t have to eat much to get significant amounts of protein
- Complete, meaning they contain all amino acids your body needs
- Bioavailable, meaning the protein they contain is easy for your body to break down and use quickly

However, many animal proteins are also significant sources of saturated fat and cholesterol, so be mindful of your portions and, in general, prefer leaner cuts. 

| Food Name | Easy Prep Suggestions |
| --- | --- |
| Lentils | Boil or use canned; add to soups or salads |
| Chickpeas | Rinse canned; roast or add to wraps |
| Black Beans | Rinse canned; add to salads or tacos |
| Edamame | Microwave from frozen; sprinkle with salt |
| Tofu | Cube and stir-fry, grill, or bake |
| Tempeh | Slice and pan-fry with soy sauce |
| Quinoa | Boil; use as a base for bowls |
| Seitan | Slice and stir-fry or grill |
| Peanut Butter | Spread on toast, apple slices, or celery |

**High-Protein Snacks**

Snacks are an extra high-impact place to sneak in protein, because they control hunger between meals, prevent energy crashes, and reduce impulsive eating later in the day.

| Food Name | Easy Prep Suggestions |
| --- | --- |
| Hard-Boiled Eggs | Make in bulk; store in fridge |
| Jerky (beef/turkey) | Keep in pantry for quick snack |
| Protein Powder | Blend with milk/water; add to oatmeal |
| String Cheese | Eat straight from package |
| Roasted Chickpeas | Buy pre-made or roast at home |
| Trail Mix (nut-heavy) | Portion into small bags for quick grab |
| Cottage Cheese Cups | Buy single-serve for easy access |
| Greek Yogurt Cups | Add berries or granola |

## **Protein Add-In Guide**

Protein isn’t just for meatheaads. It’s a cornerstone nutrient for feeling full, maintaining muscle, and stable energy levels. You don’t need to overhaul your meals; you just need a few strategic add-ins and swaps to make your existing favorites more protein-packed.

Below are quick, no-fuss ways to give the most common breakfasts, lunches, and dinners a protein boost.

**Breakfast**

Ensuring a protein-rich breakfast improves energy levels in the morning, regulate satiety for the rest of the day, and even reduce the chances of late-night snacking,

| Common Meal Template | Low-Friction Protein Add-In |
| --- | --- |
| Cereal with milk | Use high-protein milk (cow’s, soy, or ultra-filtered) |
| Toast with butter/jam | Add scrambled eggs or cottage cheese on the side |
| Eggs and toast | Add turkey sausage or a side of Greek yogurt |
| Smoothie | Add a scoop of protein powder or Greek yogurt |
| Yogurt with toppings | Choose Greek yogurt or skyr and add nuts/seeds |

**Lunch**

Increasing protein exposure in lunch is usually as simple as scaling up something you already do, *or* adding to something you already eat. 

Always have a salad? Add some lentils. Sandwich with deli meat? Double deli meat. Wrap with chicken and rice? Great. Now it’s chicken, *beans,* and rice*.* 

| Common Meal Template | Low-Friction Protein Add-In |
| --- | --- |
| Sandwich | Use extra deli meat or add cheese/egg |
| Salad | Add grilled chicken, tuna, or tofu |
| Soup | Stir in shredded chicken, beans, or lentils |
| Wrap or burrito | Use whole wheat wrap and double the protein filling |
| Leftover pasta | Add shrimp, chicken, or canned tuna |

**Dinner**

Dinners modify similarly to lunches, but on a grander scale: Do more of what you already do, or add to something you already eat.

| Common Meal Template | Low-Friction Protein Add-In |
| --- | --- |
| Chicken with rice/veg | Increase chicken portion or add edamame on the side |
| Tacos | Use lean beef, chicken, or fish and add black beans |
| Stir-fry | Add tofu, shrimp, or extra chicken/beef |
| Pizza | Top with extra chicken, turkey pepperoni, or seitan |
| Fish with potatoes | Add a bean salad or lentil side dish |

### **Action Items: Ways to Practice This Habit**

You know the drill: Try a different tactic each day, or choose the ones that resonate most. 

| **Technique** | **How To Do It** |
| --- | --- |
| **Palm Rule** | Use your palm to portion protein at each meal—one palm (~3–4 oz, 1 inch thick) if you're regulating hunger or weight loss, two palms if you're active or trying to gain. Easy, visual, and portion-appropriate. |
| **Protein at Breakfast** | Start your day with at least one palm of protein, ideally two. Eggs, Greek yogurt, cottage cheese, a tofu scramble, or a bean-rich breakfast bowl. This one shift can calm hunger for the next 6 hours. |
| **Pair with Fiber** | Combine protein with a fiber-rich food (veggies, lentils, oats, whole grains) to keep blood sugar even longer. It's like pairing a seatbelt with brakes one helps, both protect. |
| **Prep One Protein Base** | Each week, prep one protein "base" you can mix and match. Cook chicken, tofu, beans, or hard-boiled eggs in advance so you always have an anchor for your meals. |
| **Snack Shift** | Instead of defaulting to carbs when you're hungry, keep quick protein snacks on hand—jerky, cottage cheese, edamame, roasted chickpeas, boiled eggs, protein shakes. Eat the carb-y snack *after* the protein source. |
| **Add Protein to Your Favorites** | You don't need to cut out your go-tos. Just *add* protein to them. Pizza? Add grilled chicken. Pasta? Toss in shrimp or lentils. Bread and butter? Layer on hummus or turkey. You're not restricting—you're *restructuring*. |

### **Accountability: Reflect, Record, Repeat**

Research shows that reflecting on outcomes—not just actions—deepens learning and builds long-term habit memory.

| **Day** | **Prompt** |
| --- | --- |
| **Monday** | Did I get at least one palm of protein at each meal? How did I feel between meals? |
| **Tuesday** | What did I notice when I started the day with a high-protein breakfast? |
| **Wednesday** | Which snack or craving time felt easiest to manage with more protein? |
| **Thursday** | How did pairing protein with fiber affect my energy or mood in the afternoon? |
| **Friday** | What did I prep or keep on hand that made eating protein easier this week? |
| **Saturday** | Where did I *add* protein to a comfort food instead of taking something away? |
| **Sunday** | Overall: What surprised me about how protein affected my hunger, mood, or food choices this week? |

Share your reflections in one of three ways:

- **Post it publicly**, using a habit hashtag or tagging a friend.
- **Tell the friend you told about this program.**
- **Record it in a private journal (digital or analog).**

Here’s a prompt for each day this week:

### Final Notes

Protein doesn’t just change your plate. It changes your ability to *listen to yourself*. It stabilizes your biology so you don’t have to white-knuckle your way through cravings or shame-spiral your way into another “reset.”

More protein. Less panic. Simple as that.
