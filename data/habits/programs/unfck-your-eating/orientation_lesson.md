### Welcome

You're in. This program is designed to help you make small, sustainable changes that compound into big results. Here's how we'll work:

- One focus each week
- One tiny practice each day
- One quick reflection to lock in the learning

### What to Expect

- You won't be perfect. You don't need to be.
- The goal is to show upâ€”briefly, consistently.
- Progress beats intensity.

### How to Win

- Each day, you'll see three things:
  1) A habit card (what to practice)
  2) A short lesson (why it matters)
  3) A journal prompt (reflect and move forward)

That's it. Keep it simple. Keep going.
