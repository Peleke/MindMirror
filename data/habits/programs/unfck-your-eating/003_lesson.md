Let’s be real: you eat fast, you snack when you’re stressed, and by late afternoon you find yourself suddenly craving…something. Anything. And when that snack *doesn’t* deliver—hello, second helping.

Most of us are chronically under-fibered, and it’s hiding in plain sight. We reach for what’s easy—pizza, white bread, chips—because they feel familiar, comforting, and safe. But here's the hidden cost: **low-fiber diets sabotage your fullness signals, your digestion, and your ability to trust yourself around food**. You stay stuck in loops—way too hungry, way too fast, way too anxious.

This habit isn’t about elimination. It’s about displacement. Try this: before you eat *anything else*, take just one smart carbohydrate (beans, quinoa, oats) plus a colorful fiber-rich food (berries, greens, carrots). Then you can have your slice of pizza if you want. But usually? That slice doesn’t taste like it used to. That’s the quiet power of fiber: **it reshapes your cravings from the inside out**. And it's this shift—over time—that quiets the internal chaos.

> Soft reminder: If you signed up because you want food to feel easier, calmer, more under your control—start with fiber. It doesn’t ask more of you; it gives more back.

### **Evidence**

**Fiber deficiency shows up in every way that keeps you from feeling like yourself**: dramatic blood sugar swings, constant hunger, digestive bloating, and a brain that’s fogged-out and craving dopamine from sugar crashes. A landmark study in *The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition* found that adults in modern industrialized diets consume **40–60% less fiber** than our Paleolithic ancestors—and suffer the consequences in terms of weight gain and metabolic instability¹.

Controlled intervention trials show consistent results: increasing fiber intake reduces energy intake—even without instructing calorie cuts—and boosts satiety, while improving markers like HbA1c and triglycerides.² For example, participants who added just **10 grams of fiber** per day reported up to **30% fewer snack foods consumed** throughout the day. That’s a full behavior shift—with microscopic effort.

High-fiber, plant-forward diets in populations like Okinawa, the Andes, and parts of Africa show dramatic reductions in obesity, diabetes, and GI disorders³. These regions prioritize beans, root vegetables, seeds, and whole grains—not paleo or keto—but fiber-first for longevity and resilience. When humans get enough fiber, their *cravings turn off, digestion resets, and energy stabilizes*—so they don’t reach for food as a pressure valve.

For someone who’s tired of the spin cycle—overeating, guilt, energy crashes—fiber *is* your reset button. And this isn’t theoretical. Studies repeatedly show that eating fiber-rich meals first displaces less-nutritious choices later—without willpower, without deprivation. Just structural shift.

### Interlude: Dietary Displacement and the Palm Rules

So far, we’ve focused on *how* you eat—slowing down, tasting your food, cutting distractions. That’s powerful on its own. But now, we start addressing *what* you eat—and here’s the good news: we’re not going to start by removing anything.

Instead, we’ll use **dietary displacement**—a simple, non-restrictive method that’s been shown to naturally reduce less-nutritious choices without forcing willpower or deprivation. The concept is straightforward: before you eat *anything else*, you add nutrient-dense, fiber-rich foods first. This naturally “displaces” other foods, because you’ve already met much of your hunger and nutrient needs.

A meta-analysis in *Appetite* found that eating low-calorie, high-volume foods (like vegetables, beans, and whole grains) before other items can reduce total energy intake by **15–20%**—without telling participants to “eat less.”⁴ Similar findings appear in research on preload strategies, where a small salad or bean dish before a main meal consistently led to fewer calories consumed overall⁵. You don’t fight cravings—you front-load the good stuff so cravings lose their bite.

> This is addition, not subtraction. You eat what you normally eat—just with the healthy stuff first. Over time, your taste preferences and appetite shift naturally.
> 

**From here on, every habit will use displacement.**

Whether it’s fiber, protein, or healthy fats, you’ll add nutrient-rich foods *first* so less-nutritious items naturally take a back seat. No bans. No rules about “never again.” No measuring cups. Just a structure that makes the better choice the easier one.

### **The Palm Rules: A Built-in Portion Guide**

To make displacement easier, we’ll borrow the **Palm Rules** from [Precision Nutrition](https://www.precisionnutrition.com/hand-portion-faq) (full credit to their excellent system). It’s a quick, visual way to gauge balanced portions—no scales, no measuring cups—so you can make balanced plates anywhere.

| **Portion Type** | **Your Hand Guide** | **Why It Works** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Protein** | 1 palm per meal (women), 2 palms (men) | Helps maintain muscle, keeps you fuller longer. |
| **Vegetables** | 1 fist per meal (women), 2 fists (men) | Adds volume, fiber, micronutrients—key for displacement. |
| **Smart Carbs** (whole grains, beans, fruit) | 1 cupped hand per meal (women), 2 cupped hands (men) | Stable energy, fewer blood sugar crashes. |
| **Healthy Fats** (nuts, seeds, oils) | 1 thumb per meal (women), 2 thumbs (men) | Supports hormones, satiety, flavor. |

This week, we’re fiber-first*.* So, ensure **vegetables and smart carbs** (fist + cupped hand) are on your plate *before* or *with* other foods.

### **Pushback**

This habits generates less pushback than putting the phone down…But, there are a few common ways our brains resist this one.

**“But I don’t want to give up pizza/bread…”**

Again: You don’t have to. Instead, use *dietary displacement*: eat fiber-rich, nutrient-dense food *before* your usual choices.

Think: 1 smart carb (beans, oats, quinoa) + 1 fiber color (greens, berries). Then you can have the slice.

But by starting with the good stuff, your hunger curve shifts. That slice becomes an optional extra—not a need.

Over time, you cultivate more appetite for nutrition, less for instant hits of sugar and fat. And when you repeat that structure enough? You don’t need more willpower—it just becomes how you eat.

**“Fiber bloats me.”**

Fair. That’s normal—for a while. As your gut microbiome gradually adapts, you might feel gas or bloating for 3–5 days, especially if your intake jumps drastically.

But that can be mitigated by **gradually increasing fibers and drinking water**. Also, **understand** that soluble fiber (oats, beans) and insoluble fiber (greens, seeds) behave differently. Start with easier fiber (steamed greens, lentils) before tackling high-resistant starch.

The discomfort is usually temporary; it’s just your gut rebalancing.

If the discomfort is severe, or does not improve with time, then revert to your normal eating and reach out for advice.  

**“Fiber is boring.”**

Only if you limit yourself to iceberg lettuce and plain boiled broccoli.

Let’s get creative: sweet potatoes with cumin and lime, hummus with paprikas, lentil chili with cilantro, chia pudding with berries, edamame tossed with ginger and garlic. Cheap beans and grains are nutrient-dense powerhouses—flavor-rich and affordable.

## **Fiber Add-In Guide**

For this week’s habit, you don’t have to cut your favorite meals, just sneak fiber into what you already eat. Think of it like upgrading the “base model” version of your food so it’s more filling, better for digestion, and friendlier to your blood sugar. 

Below you’ll see easy ways to add fiber to common breakfasts, lunches, and dinners—no extreme recipes, just swaps and add-ins you’ll actually use.

**Breakfast**

| Common Meal Template | Low-Friction Fiber Add-In |

| Cereal with milk | Sprinkle in 2 Tbsp chia seeds, flax meal, or nuts; switch to a high-fiber cereal; add fresh and/or dried fruit |
| Toast with butter/jam | Add a layer of mashed avocado or berries; use whole grain bread |
| Eggs and toast | Add a side of sautéed spinach or a handful of berries |
| Smoothie | Add frozen berries, spinach, or 2 Tbsp flax meal |
| Yogurt with toppings | Use Greek yogurt and top with raspberries, blackberries, or high-fiber granola |

**Lunch**

### **Action Items: Ways to Practice This Habit**

You know the drill: Try a different tactic each day, or choose the ones that resonate most. 

| Technique | **How to Do It** |
| --- | --- |
| **Rainbow First** | Choose at least three different colored vegetables or fruits. Plate or eat them *before* your main meal. |
| **Smart Swap** | Replace one refined carb (white rice, bread) with quinoa, lentils, oats, or barley. |
| **Fiber Starter: Soup or Salad** | Begin your meal with a bowl of vegetable bean soup, lentil stew, or chilled salad of beans/chickpeas. |
| **Hand-Plate Method** | Use your fist for vegetables, palm for protein, cupped hand for smart carbs. Ensure fiber dominates your plate. |
| **Flavor Boost** | Add herbs, spices, and seeds (chia, flax, cumin, garlic) to fiber foods for flavor and satiety. |
| **Displacement Challenge** | Before comfort food, eat one smart carb and one fiber-rich food first—even if it's just a handful of beans and a carrot. Notice appetite afterward. |

### **Accountability & Reflection Prompts**

This all works better if  you journal about your experience daily, even if briefly. Remember: We’re not just building habits, but also *awareness.*

Take a moment each day to reflect on one of the prompts below.

| **Day** | **Prompt** |
| --- | --- |
| **Monday** | What colors did I eat before the meal? Did I feel more full afterward? |
| **Tuesday** | What smart carb swap did I make? How did that shift cravings or energy? |
| **Wednesday** | Did beginning with bean soup or salad reduce how much I ate later? |
| **Thursday** | Was portion control easier using the hand-plate method? |
| **Friday** | What flavor/spice made fiber food satisfying today? |
| **Saturday** | How did eating fiber before comfort food affect how much I actually ate afterward? |

**Tell someone what you come up with**.

Don’t keep your experience to yourself. Did eating more fiber make you feel better? Did it suck? Was it easy, or a breeze?

Tell your friends, coach, or followers how more fiber made you feel.   

---

### Final Notes

Fiber is not a fad. It’s a shift.

More fiber equals more fullness, less emotional eating, better energy, and a gut that communicates clearly about what it really needs.

Combine this habit with eating slowly and eating without screens, and you’ll start experiencing meals that feel *healing*, not overwhelming.

You don’t have to give up what you love. You have to make space for what your body deserves.
