# üß† MindMirror: Vision, Roadmap & Project Status

## 1. The Vision: Your Generative Performance Engine

MindMirror is a symbiotic system that fuses trusted, external wisdom with a user's own internal, subjective experience. It is not merely a tool, but a digital twin of the user's performance journey.

The ultimate goal is to create a **generative performance engine**. A user shouldn't just ask "What should I eat?"; they should be able to state a complex, multi-faceted goal in natural language and have the system generate a complete, actionable plan.

## 2. Personas We Serve

We are building for individuals who are proactive about their well-being but face common, complex challenges. Our target personas include:

*   **The Overwhelmed Beginner:** Knows they need to make a change but is paralyzed by information overload and a fear of getting it wrong. They need clear guidance, a low barrier to entry, and a plan that feels achievable.
    *   *"I've been running and lifting some weights for a while but don't really know what to do next. I like yoga a lot. Can you make me a 6-week program for getting started with strength? I'm scared of gyms though."*

*   **The Life-Constrained Optimizer:** Already has an established routine and goals but needs to adapt them to the messy reality of life‚Äîtravel, stress, lack of equipment, or fluctuating energy levels.
    *   *"I'm going on vacation for two weeks with no equipment. I'd like to keep working out to the same goals; can you update my plans?"*

*   **The Holistic Explorer:** Views their body and mind as a single system and is keen to experiment with different philosophies (e.g., Ayurveda, Stoicism, Paleo) to see how they impact mood, energy, and performance.
    *   *"I'm having trouble sleeping; I'm pretty sure it's my eating. Can you give me an Ayurvedic diet and adjust my yoga flows? I've been having lots of kapha energy."*

*   **The Habit Builder:** Feels "off track" and needs help building foundational habits to regain a sense of control and well-being, starting with small, atomic actions.
    *   *"I'm a fucking wreck lately. Give me 4 habits to build that will help me with sleep and eating a reasonable diet."*

## 3. Current Architecture: A Federated Microservices System

MindMirror is built as a distributed system of specialized microservices, orchestrated by a federated GraphQL gateway. This architecture enables independent scaling, development, and deployment of each domain.

### Production Services Currently Deployed

*   **Agent Service (Port 8000):** The AI reasoning engine with RAG capabilities, powered by LangChain and either OpenAI or Ollama. Handles semantic search, knowledge retrieval, and AI-powered responses.
*   **Journal Service (Port 8001):** Manages all journaling functionality including structured (Gratitude, Reflection) and freeform entries with automatic vector indexing.
*   **Hive Gateway (Port 4000):** GraphQL federation layer that unifies all microservices into a single API surface with JWT authentication and request routing.
*   **Next.js Web App (Port 3001):** Modern, responsive frontend with Apollo Client, authentication, and real-time updates.
*   **Streamlit UI (Port 8501):** Legacy interface for AI coaching and document management (transitioning to Next.js).

### Supporting Infrastructure

*   **PostgreSQL:** Primary relational database for all structured data
*   **Qdrant:** Vector database for semantic search over documents and journal entries
*   **Redis:** Message broker for Celery task queue
*   **Celery Workers:** Background processing for document indexing and AI tasks
*   **Flower (Port 5555):** Real-time monitoring of background tasks

## 5. üöß Known Issues & Technical Debt

### Frontend Issues

#### 1. Journal History Caching
**Priority:** Medium  
**Description:** When a new journal entry is submitted, the history page doesn't auto-update without manual refresh.  
**Root Cause:** Apollo Client cache not being invalidated after mutations.  
**Solution:** Add `refetchQueries` to mutation hooks for `GET_JOURNAL_ENTRIES`.

#### 2. Middleware Authentication Non-Functional
**Priority:** Low  
**Description:** The `middleware.ts` file exists but is not being executed by Next.js.  
**Location:** `/web/middleware.ts`  
**Impact:** Admin routes are unprotected, but admin functionality is not currently in use.  
**Solution:** Verify file placement and Next.js configuration.

### Backend & Infrastructure

#### 3. Ollama Environment Detection
**Priority:** Medium  
**Description:** Embedding service URL needs better environment detection for local vs Docker deployment.  
**Current State:** Hardcoded to `host.docker.internal:11434`  
**Solution:** Add dynamic URL resolution based on deployment context.

#### 4. Error Handling Standardization
**Priority:** Low  
**Description:** Inconsistent error handling patterns across microservices.  
**Solution:** Implement standardized error schemas and handling middleware.

### Documentation

#### 5. API Documentation Gaps
**Priority:** Low  
**Description:** GraphQL schema needs better field descriptions for frontend development.  
**Solution:** Add comprehensive `@doc` directives to all schema fields.

## 6. üîÆ Next Phase: The LangGraph-Powered Agent Kernel

The next evolution of MindMirror is to build a robust agentic kernel. After careful consideration, the development will proceed in two distinct phases:

1.  **Phase 1 (Next Milestone):** Use **LangGraph** to build the foundational, stateful workflows for core business domains. This is for creating reliable, testable, and deterministic "subroutines" that handle complex but well-defined tasks (e.g., "summarize my journal entries for the last two weeks" or "build me a workout for tomorrow").
2.  **Phase 2 (Future Vision):** Layer **AutoGen** on top as a master orchestrator for handling complex, open-ended user requests that require decomposing the problem into multiple steps that the underlying LangGraph workflows can solve.

### Core Concept: Dynamic Tool Discovery via GraphQL Introspection

The key to decoupling the agent from the tools remains the same. We will use the GraphQL Gateway as a dynamic tool registry.

1.  **Schema as a Tool-Manifest:** Any `Query` or `Mutation` in the federated schema can be a tool. The GraphQL `description` field is used as an LLM-friendly prompt explaining what the tool does and when it should be used.
2.  **The `@agentTool` Directive:** A custom directive (`@agentTool`) will be added to the Gateway to explicitly mark which schema fields are available to the agent, providing fine-grained, declarative control from within each microservice.
3.  **Introspection on Startup:** When the `AgentService` boots, it runs a GraphQL introspection query against the Gateway to fetch all fields marked with `@agentTool`.
4.  **Dynamic Tool Generation:** For each discovered field, the service generates a corresponding Python function in memory. This function is pre-configured to execute a GraphQL call against the Gateway.

### Integration with LangGraph: A Stateful Flowchart

This dynamic toolset will be wielded by an agent defined as a state machine or "flowchart" using LangGraph.

*   **The State Object:** A central Pydantic model will define the `State` of the graph, containing things like the original user input, a list of steps to take, tool results, and the final response. This object is passed between all nodes.
*   **The Nodes:** Each node in the graph is a function that performs a specific task:
    *   **`plan_step`:** Takes the user input and the current state to decide which tool to call next.
    *   **`execute_tool`:** Calls the chosen tool (one of the dynamically generated GraphQL functions) and populates its result into the state object.
    *   **`synthesize_response`:** Generates the final user-facing answer once the plan is complete.
*   **The Edges:** Conditional edges connect the nodes, routing the flow of control based on the current state (e.g., looping to execute more tools or proceeding to the final response).

### TDD-Based Implementation Plan

This architecture will be built using a Test-Driven Development approach.

1.  **[TEST] Step 1: Build the Agent's Front Door & Intent Router:**
    *   **Implement:** Create a new `/chat` HTTP endpoint in the `AgentService`. This will be the primary entry point for all agentic interactions.
    *   **Implement:** This endpoint will invoke a new LangGraph graph. The entry point node for this graph will be an **Intent Router**.
    *   **Test:** The router's job is to classify the user's raw input. Write unit tests to ensure that given a user query, the router correctly classifies it into categories like `simple_rag_query`, `journal_summary_request`, or `complex_planning_request`.
    *   **Assert:** The graph should branch to different, simple handler nodes based on the router's output.

2.  **[TEST] Step 2: Test GraphQL Introspection & Tool Generation:**
    *   Write unit tests to verify that the system can correctly query a mock GraphQL schema, filter for `@agentTool` fields, and generate callable Python functions that produce the correct GraphQL query strings.

3.  **[TEST] Step 3: Test LangGraph State & Nodes:**
    *   Write unit tests for each individual node in the graph. For the `plan_step` node, mock an LLM call and assert it produces the correct plan. For the `execute_tool` node, assert that it correctly calls the dynamic tool function with the right arguments from the state.

4.  **[TEST] Step 4: Test LangGraph Conditional Edges:**
    *   Write unit tests to verify the routing logic. Given a specific `State` (e.g., one where the plan is complete), assert that the graph correctly routes to the `synthesize_response` node.

5.  **[TEST] Step 5: Test Full Graph Flow (Integration):**
    *   Write an integration test that compiles the full LangGraph graph.
    *   Initiate the graph with a user prompt that requires tool use. Mock the LLM calls and the GraphQL client.
    *   Assert that the graph transitions through the correct sequence of nodes and that the final state contains the expected response.

## 7. üß† Future Vision: The AutoGen Orchestrator

Once the foundational LangGraph workflows for core domains are built and tested, we will introduce **AutoGen** as a higher-level "CEO" agent.

This agent will be responsible for tackling complex, multi-domain user requests like:

> *"Plan me a workout and nutrition program based on my goals, the fact I'm trying to go vegetarian, and am training for a marathon but happen to have a right shoulder impingement."*

To solve this, the AutoGen orchestrator won't call the GraphQL tools directly. Instead, its "tools" will be the pre-built, reliable **LangGraph graphs**. It will decompose the user's request and invoke the `GraphRAG` graph, the `WorkoutPlanner` graph, and the `Nutrition` graph in sequence, synthesizing their outputs into a single, comprehensive plan.

This two-layer architecture provides the best of both worlds: the deterministic reliability of LangGraph for core processes and the emergent, conversational intelligence of AutoGen for high-level orchestration.

## 9. üîÆ Long-Term Vision: The Knowledge Graph Evolution

### Current Stack Evolution
Moving from the current **Postgres + Qdrant** foundation to **Postgres + Qdrant + Knowledge Graph** for deeper relationship modeling.

| Aspect | Current (Postgres + Qdrant) | Future (+ Knowledge Graph) |
|--------|-------------------------------|----------------------------|
| **Strength** | Best-of-breed services optimized for their purpose | Explicit relationship modeling as first-class citizen |
| **Query Pattern** | Two-step: Find in Postgres ‚Üí Search in Qdrant | Single graph traversal with rich relationship context |
| **Example** | "Find stoic advice for anxiety" *requires app orchestration* | "Find `(Advice)` connected to `(Stoic)` tradition and `(Concept:anxiety)` mentioned in recent `(Journal)` entries" |

### Implementation Strategy
1. **Maintain Current Foundation** - Postgres + Qdrant remains source of truth
2. **Add Graph Projection** - Project data into knowledge graph via CDC pipeline
3. **Hybrid Queries** - Combine vector search with graph traversal for deeper insights
