## üóÇÔ∏è Data Architecture

### üìã Template vs Instance Pattern

The system uses a sophisticated **Template/Instance** pattern for workout management:

**Templates** (Design Phase - Coaches/Users):
```
PracticeTemplate
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ PrescriptionTemplate (Warmup/Workout/Cooldown)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ MovementTemplate (Exercise with parameters)
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ SetTemplate (Reps/Weight/Duration specifications)
```

**Instances** (Execution Phase - Clients):
```
PracticeInstance (Actual workout)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ PrescriptionInstance (Executed prescription)
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ MovementInstance (Performed movement)
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ SetInstance (Completed set with actual values)
```

This separation enables:
- **Reusability:** Templates can generate multiple instances
- **Customization:** Instances can be modified without affecting templates
- **Progress Tracking:** Actual performance vs. prescribed parameters
- **Data Integrity:** Template changes don't affect historical data

### üîê Authorization Model

**Role-Based Access Control:**
- **Coaches:** Create templates, manage client relationships, assign programs
- **Clients:** Execute workouts, modify their instances, enroll in programs
- **Relationship Verification:** Coaches can only manage their verified clients

**Permission Matrix:**
| Entity | Coach (Own) | Coach (Client) | Client (Own) | Client (Other) |
|--------|-------------|----------------|--------------|----------------|
| Templates | CRUD | Read | Read | Read |
| Instances | Read | Read | CRUD | None |
| Programs | CRUD | Assign | Enroll | Read |
| Enrollments | Read | CRUD | CRUD (own) | None |
