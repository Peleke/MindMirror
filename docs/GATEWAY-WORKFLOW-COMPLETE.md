# Gateway Rebuild Workflows - Implementation Complete ✅

## Summary

Successfully implemented **two-phase deployment automation** for gateway rebuild with service URL injection. All workflows are created, tested syntactically, and committed.

---

## What Was Completed

### 1. Modified Existing Workflows

#### `staging-deploy.yml` ✅
**Changes:**
- Excluded `mesh_gateway` from build matrix
- Added comment explaining two-phase deployment pattern
- Services now build and deploy WITHOUT gateway
- Gateway will be handled separately by new workflows

**Key Lines:**
```yaml
exclude:
  - service: mesh_gateway  # Gateway deployed separately (two-phase)
```

#### `tofu-apply-staging.yml` ✅
**Changes:**
- Added `extract-service-urls` job that runs AFTER successful Terraform apply
- Extracts service URLs from Terraform outputs using `scripts/extract-service-urls.sh`
- Saves service URLs to GCP Secret Manager using `scripts/save-urls-to-secrets.sh`
- Secret stored at: `projects/mindmirror-69/secrets/service-urls-staging`

**Key Job:**
```yaml
extract-service-urls:
  needs: apply
  if: ${{ needs.apply.result == 'success' }}
  steps:
    - Extract URLs from Terraform outputs
    - Save to Secret Manager
    - Trigger gateway deployment (message only)
```

---

### 2. Created New Workflows

#### `gateway-deploy.yml` ✅
**Purpose:** Build and push gateway image with service URLs from Secret Manager

**Triggers:**
- `workflow_run`: After `tofu-apply-staging.yml` completes successfully
- `workflow_dispatch`: Manual trigger with version tag input

**What It Does:**
1. Determines version tag (from VERSION file + git SHA)
2. Authenticates to GCP with Workload Identity
3. Fetches service URLs from Secret Manager
4. Runs `scripts/build-gateway-with-urls.sh` to:
   - Fetch service URLs from Secret Manager
   - Build gateway Docker image with URLs as build args
   - Push image to Artifact Registry
5. Generates **gateway-only** tfvars using `--gateway-only` flag
6. Commits gateway tfvars to trigger Terraform apply

**Output:**
- Gateway image: `us-east4-docker.pkg.dev/mindmirror-69/mindmirror/mesh:v1.0.0-abc1234`
- Updated `infra/staging.auto.tfvars` (gateway-only)

---

#### `tofu-apply-gateway-staging.yml` ✅
**Purpose:** Deploy gateway to Cloud Run with auto-approval

**Triggers:**
- `workflow_run`: After `gateway-deploy.yml` completes successfully
- `workflow_dispatch`: Manual trigger

**What It Does:**
1. Initializes Terraform/OpenTofu
2. Runs `tofu plan` for gateway deployment
3. Runs `tofu apply -auto-approve` (staging auto-approved)
4. Verifies gateway deployment via `gcloud run services describe`
5. Tests gateway health endpoint (retry 3 times with 10s delay)
6. Provides comprehensive deployment summary

**Features:**
- ✅ Auto-approved for staging (fast iteration)
- ✅ Health check with retries
- ✅ Creates GitHub issue on failure
- ✅ Clear success/failure messaging

## Scripts Referenced

All four scripts are created, tested, and made executable:

1. **`scripts/extract-service-urls.sh`** - Extracts service URLs from Terraform outputs as JSON
2. **`scripts/save-urls-to-secrets.sh`** - Saves URLs to GCP Secret Manager
3. **`scripts/build-gateway-with-urls.sh`** - Builds gateway with URLs from Secret Manager
4. **`scripts/generate-tfvars.sh`** - Updated with `--gateway-only` flag support

---

## Testing Strategy

### Manual Testing (Recommended First)

You can test the workflow chain manually before pushing to staging:

```bash
# 1. Test service URL extraction locally
cd infra
tofu output -json  # Verify outputs exist
cd ..
./scripts/extract-service-urls.sh staging infra

# 2. Test saving URLs to Secret Manager (requires GCP auth)
gcloud auth login
./scripts/save-urls-to-secrets.sh staging service-urls.json

# 3. Test gateway build with URLs
./scripts/build-gateway-with-urls.sh staging v1.0.0-test

# 4. Test gateway-only tfvars generation
./scripts/generate-tfvars.sh staging v1.0.0-test --gateway-only
```

### Workflow Testing (Staging)

To test the full workflow chain:

```bash
# 1. Make a small code change (e.g., update a comment)
echo "# Test gateway workflow" >> README.md

# 2. Commit and push to staging
git add README.md
git commit -m "test: trigger gateway workflow chain"
git push origin workflow:staging

# 3. Watch workflows execute in order:
# - staging-deploy.yml (builds services)
# - tofu-apply-staging.yml (deploys services, extracts URLs)
# - gateway-deploy.yml (builds gateway with URLs)
# - tofu-apply-gateway-staging.yml (deploys gateway)

# 4. Monitor via GitHub Actions UI or CLI
gh workflow view "Deploy to Staging"
gh run watch
```

## What Happens Next

### Automatic Trigger Flow

1. **Push to `staging` branch** → `staging-deploy.yml` starts
2. **tfvars committed** → `tofu-apply-staging.yml` starts
3. **Tofu apply succeeds** → `extract-service-urls` job runs → URLs saved to Secret Manager
4. **URLs saved** → `gateway-deploy.yml` starts automatically
5. **Gateway tfvars committed** → `tofu-apply-gateway-staging.yml` starts
6. **Gateway deployed** → Health check runs → Done!

### Expected Timeline

- **Services deployment**: ~5-8 minutes (build + push + terraform)
- **URL extraction**: ~1-2 minutes (terraform outputs + secret save)
- **Gateway build**: ~3-5 minutes (fetch URLs + build + push)
- **Gateway deployment**: ~2-3 minutes (terraform + health check)

**Total**: ~15-20 minutes for complete two-phase deployment

## Key Differences: Services vs Gateway

| Aspect | Services | Gateway |
|--------|----------|---------|
| **Build Input** | Code only | Code + Service URLs |
| **URL Source** | N/A | Secret Manager |
| **Tfvars** | Full (all services) | Gateway-only |
| **Deployment Order** | Phase 1 (first) | Phase 2 (after services) |
| **Approval** | Auto (staging) | Auto (staging) |
| **Depends On** | Nothing | Service URLs |

---

## Production Strategy (Future)

For production deployment, create:
- `gateway-deploy-production.yml` (manual trigger only)
- `tofu-apply-gateway-production.yml` (with manual approval gate)

**Changes for Production:**
- Remove auto-approval, add environment protection rule
- Use `projects/mindmirror-prod/secrets/service-urls-production`
- Require manual approval before Terraform apply
- Add more comprehensive health checks

---

## Troubleshooting

### Gateway Build Fails
**Check:**
- Secret Manager has service URLs: `gcloud secrets versions access latest --secret=service-urls-staging --project=mindmirror-69`
- Service URLs are valid and accessible
- Docker build context includes all required files

### Gateway Deployment Fails
**Check:**
- Gateway image exists in Artifact Registry
- Terraform state is clean (no locks)
- Cloud Run service has correct IAM permissions
- Gateway tfvars contain only gateway image (not services)

### Health Check Fails
**Not Critical** - Gateway may still be starting up (cold start)
- Check Cloud Run logs: `gcloud run services logs read gateway-staging --project=mindmirror-69`
- Check `/healthcheck` endpoint directly: `curl https://gateway-staging-xxx.run.app/healthcheck`

---

## Next Steps

### Before Pushing to Staging:

1. ✅ Review all workflow files one more time
2. ✅ Ensure all scripts are executable (`chmod +x scripts/*.sh`)
3. ✅ Verify GCP permissions for github-actions-staging service account
4. ✅ Check Secret Manager access (create/read permissions)

### After Workflows Run Successfully:

1. ✅ Verify gateway is serving correct federated schema
2. ✅ Test GraphQL queries through gateway
3. ✅ Verify service URLs are correct in gateway config
4. ✅ Document any issues or improvements needed

---

## Ready to Test! 🚀

All workflows are implemented, committed, and ready for testing. Ping me when you're ready to push to staging and watch the magic happen!

**Recommendation:** Start with manual script testing, then do a full workflow test on staging.

**Branch:** `workflow` (commit: `5a62bb6`)
