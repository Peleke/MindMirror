# Alpha Validation: Week 1 Push

**Goal:** Stress test existing voucher/enrollment infrastructure with User 1, THEN onboard Users 2-3.

**Timeline:** Next 7 days

**Decision Point:** After 4 weeks, gut-check which demographic to double down on (likely combat sports).

---

## Existing Infrastructure (Already Built)

**7-Step Voucher/Magic Link System:**

1. ‚úÖ **Link Generation** - Magic link with embedded voucher
2. ‚úÖ **Voucher Creation** - Clicking link mints voucher (email + program ID)
   - Confirmed working for: habits_service, lessons
   - **Needs stress testing for:** practices_service (workouts)
3. ‚úÖ **Signup Redirect** - Link ‚Üí Supabase signup page
4. ‚úÖ **Email Matching** - Signup email matches voucher recipient (Supabase validation)
5. ‚úÖ **Auto-Enrollment on Login** - Voucher check ‚Üí program assignment
   - GraphQL endpoints: `habits_service`, `practices_service`
6. ‚úÖ **Program Visibility** - User sees assigned workout in UI
7. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Workout Execution** - User logs sets/reps/rest (needs polish + bug fixes)

**Key File Locations:**
- Voucher minting: `web/supabase/edge-functions/`
- Auto-enroll (workouts): `practices_service/` GraphQL endpoint
- Workout UI: `mindmirror-mobile/app/(app)/client/[id].tsx`

**Week 1 Strategy:**

---

## Weeks 2-4: Ongoing Validation

**Weekly Cadence:**

### Week 2
- **User 1 (50+ Knee):** Daily check-ins, track pain levels (1-10 scale), adjust program if needed
- **User 2 (AC Dysfunction):** Daily check-ins, monitor shoulder pain + lumbar stability improvements
- **User 3 (Combat Athlete):** Weekly in-person session + mid-week text check-in ("How was Tuesday's lift?")
- **Focus:** Fix bugs discovered in Week 1, polish UX based on feedback

### Week 3
- **User 1:** Should see measurable improvement in knee pain (8/10 ‚Üí 5/10 target)
- **User 2:** Should notice reduced shoulder dysfunction, better posture awareness
- **User 3:** Should be comfortable with workout logging, able to track progressive overload
- **Focus:** Test program progression (does app automatically advance users to next phase?)

### Week 4
- **User 1:** Gut-check - is she still engaged? Would she pay $25/month for this?
- **User 2:** Gut-check - does he see value? Would he recommend to friends?
- **User 3:** Gut-check - is this better than a generic workout app? Would other fighters use this?
- **Focus:** Decision point - which demographic showed strongest engagement?

## Feedback Collection (Lightweight)

**For Users 1 & 2 (Daily Check-ins):**
- Quick text: "How was today's workout? Anything broken or confusing?"
- Track pain levels: "Knee pain today? 1-10 scale"
- Note any bugs/UX friction in a simple spreadsheet or note

**For User 3 (Weekly Check-ins):**
- In-person or video call: "Walk me through your last 2 workouts. What sucked?"
- Ask about specific features: "Did the rest timer work? Was weight tracking easy?"
- Note any feature requests: "What would make this app way better for you?"

**Simple Tracking Spreadsheet:**

| User | Date | Workout Completed | Pain Level (1-10) | Bugs Reported | Feature Requests | Would Recommend? |
|------|------|-------------------|-------------------|---------------|------------------|------------------|

## Decision Framework (End of Week 4)

**Question:** Which demographic should we double down on?

**Gut-Check Indicators:**

### Combat Athletes (User 3 + potential gym referrals)
- **Strong signal:** User 3 enthusiastic, brings training partners to test app
- **Strong signal:** User 3 willing to pay $25/month, sees clear value over YouTube
- **Strong signal:** Easy to recruit more testers (gym has 50+ members, tight community)
- **Weak signal:** User 3 completes workouts but doesn't engage deeply
- **Weak signal:** Hard to recruit more testers (gym members aren't interested)

### 50+ Demographic (User 1)
- **Strong signal:** User 1 sees measurable pain reduction (8/10 ‚Üí 3/10 in 4 weeks)
- **Strong signal:** User 1 tells friends about app, volunteers testimonial
- **Strong signal:** Willing to pay because "it's cheaper than physical therapy"
- **Weak signal:** User 1 drops off after 2 weeks, says "I forgot to use it"
- **Weak signal:** Pain didn't improve (program didn't work or adherence was low)

### Desk Workers / Posture Dysfunction (User 2)
- **Strong signal:** User 2 sees shoulder pain reduction + functional improvement
- **Strong signal:** User 2 refers coworkers or gym friends with similar issues
- **Strong signal:** Large addressable market (everyone has desk job pain)
- **Weak signal:** User 2 completes workouts but doesn't see results
- **Weak signal:** Hard to recruit more testers (desk workers don't prioritize movement)

**Expected Outcome (Your Gut Feel):**
- **Likely winner:** Combat athletes
- **Reasoning:** Easier to access (gym community), intrinsically motivated (already train 3-6x/week), willing to pay for expertise
- **Next steps if combat wins:** Build 3-5 more combat-specific programs (striker conditioning, BJJ strength, shoulder health for boxers), recruit 10-20 beta testers from local gyms

**Backup plan if combat doesn't hit:**
- Test 50+ demographic next (recruit via Facebook, doctor referrals, senior centers)
- Build 2-3 joint-friendly programs (hip mobility, balance/fall prevention, bone density)

---

## Red Flags (Stop and Fix Immediately)

**If any of these happen in Week 1, PAUSE alpha push and fix:**

- [ ] **Voucher system breaks** - Users sign up but program doesn't auto-assign
- [ ] **Data doesn't save** - Users complete workouts but app loses their progress
- [ ] **App crashes mid-workout** - Critical UX failure, will kill engagement
- [ ] **Magic links don't work** - Users can't even sign up

**These are showstoppers. Fix before continuing.**

---

## Success Metrics (Simple)

**Minimum Success (Week 1):**
- [ ] 3/3 users signed up
- [ ] 3/3 completed at least 1 workout
- [ ] 0 critical bugs (crashes, data loss)

**Good Success (Week 4):**
- [ ] 3/3 users still engaged (completed 8+ workouts)
- [ ] Positive feedback ("I'd actually use this regularly")
- [ ] 1-2 users willing to pay $25/month
- [ ] Clear signal on which demographic is strongest

**Great Success (Week 4):**
- [ ] 3/3 users enthusiastic (volunteered testimonials without asking)
- [ ] User 3 (combat athlete) recruited 2-3 training partners to test app
- [ ] Measurable results (User 1's knee pain down 50%+, User 2's shoulder dysfunction improved)
- [ ] Clear decision to double down on combat sports niche

---

## Next Steps After Week 4

**If combat sports shows strongest signal:**
1. Build 3-5 more combat-specific programs (striker S&C, grappler strength, injury prevention)
2. Recruit 10-20 beta testers from local gyms (offer free access for 3 months)
3. Create content marketing assets (blog post: "Why Boxers Get Shoulder Impingement," free PDF lead magnets)
4. Start Reddit outreach (r/MuayThai, r/amateur_boxing, r/bjj)

**If 50+ demographic shows strongest signal:**
1. Build 3-5 joint-friendly programs (hip mobility, balance, bone density)
2. Recruit 10-20 beta testers via Facebook ads or doctor referrals
3. Create educational content (menopause + movement, fall prevention, healthy aging)
4. Test pricing ($20-30/month, position as healthcare expense)

**If both show weak signal:**
1. Re-evaluate product-market fit (maybe movement-first isn't right positioning?)
2. Test nutrition-first angle (Unfuck Your Eating program with User 1-3)
3. Consider pivoting to general wellness dashboard (broader appeal, less niche-specific)

## Infrastructure Stress Testing Checklist (Day 1-2)

**Goal:** Validate EVERY step of the voucher/enrollment/workout flow BEFORE inviting real users.

### Setup
- [ ] Create test email account (e.g., `test+alpha1@yourdomain.com`)
- [ ] Confirm User 1's knee program exists in practices_service
- [ ] Have database access ready (to verify voucher creation, enrollment status)
- [ ] Have admin panel or logs access (to monitor flow in real-time)

### Test Round 1: Happy Path (Everything Works)
- [ ] **Step 1:** Generate magic link for test email + knee program ID
- [ ] **Step 2:** Click magic link ‚Üí verify voucher mints (check database: voucher table should have new row with email + program_id)
- [ ] **Step 3:** Complete Supabase signup with SAME email as voucher
- [ ] **Step 4:** Verify email matches (Supabase should accept signup, no error)
- [ ] **Step 5:** Login to app ‚Üí verify auto-enrollment (check database: user should be enrolled in knee program)
- [ ] **Step 6:** Navigate to program in UI ‚Üí verify workout displays (exercises, sets, reps visible)
- [ ] **Step 7:** Complete full workout:
  - [ ] Log first exercise (3 sets √ó 10 reps)
  - [ ] Use rest timer between sets (verify it counts down)
  - [ ] Log second exercise (different rep scheme)
  - [ ] Mark workout as complete
  - [ ] Verify data saves (check database: workout_logs table should have entries)
- [ ] **Step 8:** Logout, login again ‚Üí verify workout history shows (progress persists)

**Expected result:** All steps work, no errors, data saves correctly.

---

### Test Round 2: Edge Case - Duplicate Magic Link Click
- [ ] **Delete test account** from database (clean slate)
- [ ] Generate new magic link
- [ ] Click link TWICE (in two different browser tabs)
- [ ] Check database: are there TWO vouchers or ONE? (should be ONE, deduplication logic)
- [ ] Complete signup
- [ ] Verify only ONE enrollment (not duplicated)

**Expected result:** System handles duplicate clicks gracefully (no duplicate vouchers/enrollments).

---

### Test Round 3: Edge Case - Email Mismatch
- [ ] Generate magic link for `test+alpha1@yourdomain.com`
- [ ] Click link (voucher mints)
- [ ] Try to sign up with DIFFERENT email (`test+alpha2@yourdomain.com`)
- [ ] **Expected behavior:** System should either:
  - Reject signup with error: "Email doesn't match voucher"
  - OR allow signup but DON'T auto-enroll (no program assigned)
- [ ] Verify user doesn't get access to program (security check)

**Expected result:** System prevents unauthorized access (email mismatch = no enrollment).

---

### Test Round 4: Edge Case - Mid-Workout Exit
- [ ] Start workout (log 1-2 exercises)
- [ ] Exit app mid-workout (close browser/app, don't mark complete)
- [ ] Re-open app, navigate back to workout
- [ ] **Check:** Does progress persist? (Are logged sets still there?)
- [ ] Complete rest of workout, mark as done
- [ ] Verify full workout saves correctly

**Expected result:** Partial progress saves (user doesn't lose data if they exit mid-workout).

---

### Test Round 5: Edge Case - Offline Mode
- [ ] Start workout
- [ ] Log 1 exercise (3 sets)
- [ ] Turn OFF internet (airplane mode or disable WiFi)
- [ ] Try to log next exercise
- [ ] **Check:** Does app crash or show graceful error?
- [ ] Turn internet back ON
- [ ] **Check:** Does data sync? (Logged sets should upload)

**Expected result:** App handles offline mode gracefully (no crash, syncs when reconnected).

---

### Test Round 6: Edge Case - Workout History Navigation
- [ ] Complete 2-3 workouts (different days)
- [ ] Navigate to workout history view
- [ ] **Check:** Can user see past workouts?
- [ ] Click on past workout ‚Üí **Check:** Can user view details (sets, reps, notes)?
- [ ] Try to edit past workout (if feature exists)

**Expected result:** Workout history is accessible and displays correctly.

---

### Test Round 7: Stress Test - Rapid Logging
- [ ] Start workout
- [ ] Log sets RAPIDLY (tap through 3 sets √ó 3 exercises = 9 logs in <1 minute)
- [ ] Mark workout complete
- [ ] Check database: Are ALL 9 sets logged correctly? (no data loss due to rapid taps)

**Expected result:** App handles rapid logging without data loss or UI bugs.

---

### Test Round 8: Polish Check - UX Friction Points
- [ ] Run through full flow ONE more time (magic link ‚Üí signup ‚Üí workout)
- [ ] Document EVERY moment of confusion:
  - [ ] Is signup flow clear? (Do you know what to click next?)
  - [ ] Is program UI intuitive? (Can you find today's workout easily?)
  - [ ] Is workout logging obvious? (Do buttons make sense?)
  - [ ] Are rest timers visible and easy to use?
  - [ ] Are error messages helpful? (If something breaks, do you know what to do?)

**Expected result:** List of 5-10 UX improvements (even if app works, note what's confusing).

---

### Bug Tracking Template

**Use this format to document bugs during stress testing:**

| Test Round | Bug Description | Severity | Steps to Reproduce | Expected Behavior | Actual Behavior |
|------------|-----------------|----------|-------------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Round 2 | Duplicate vouchers created | Critical | Click magic link twice | 1 voucher created | 2 vouchers created |
| Round 4 | Mid-workout progress lost | Critical | Exit app mid-workout, re-open | Sets persist | Sets disappeared |
| Round 8 | Rest timer not visible | Polish | Start workout, complete set | Timer shows prominently | Timer hidden in corner |

**Severity levels:**
- **Critical:** Blocks user (crashes, data loss, can't signup, can't complete workout)
- **High:** Major friction (confusing UX, error messages unclear, feature doesn't work as expected)
- **Medium:** Minor annoyance (ugly UI, small layout bugs, typos)
- **Low:** Polish (nice-to-have improvements, feature requests)

**Day 3 Priority:** Fix ALL Critical bugs before inviting User 1. High/Medium/Low can wait for Week 2.
