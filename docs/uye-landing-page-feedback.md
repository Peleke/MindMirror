# UYE Landing Page Feedback & Optimization

**Current Page:** `/landing-uye` (web/src/app/landing-uye/page.tsx)

**Overall Assessment:** Strong foundation with compelling copy and good structure. Needs minor tweaks for conversion optimization.

---

## What's Working Well

### ‚úÖ Strong Headline
**"Eat better without willpower in seven simple habits"**
- Clear benefit (eat better)
- Addresses pain point (willpower)
- Specific promise (seven habits)
- **Keep this.**

### ‚úÖ Anti-Diet Positioning
- "No macros. No shame. Just seven habits that stack wins."
- The "Traditional Dieting vs. UYE" comparison table is excellent
- Resonates with people burned out by diet culture
- **This is your differentiator - lean into it hard.**

### ‚úÖ Social Proof Structure
- Testimonials from Jordan, Riley, Sam feel authentic
- Using avatars (pravatar.cc) is fine for now
- **Replace with real testimonials ASAP after beta testing**

### ‚úÖ Founder Story
- "Our founder lost over 100 lbs combining these habits..."
- This is powerful. Could be even more prominent.
- **Consider adding a photo or expanding this section**

---

## High-Impact Changes (Conversion Optimization)

### 1. Above-the-Fold CTA is Confusing ‚ùå

**Current:**
- Email capture says "Get PDF + Tracker"
- But below it says "includes a limited-time discounted access voucher for the premium in‚Äëapp UYE program in Swae OS"
- This is unclear. What am I actually getting?

**Problem:**
- User doesn't know if they're getting the PDF immediately or waiting for a voucher
- "Swae OS" link is distracting (takes them away from conversion)
- "Limited-time discounted access" sounds like marketing fluff

**Fix:**
```tsx
// Replace line 76
<p className="text-sm text-gray-500">
  Enter your email to get instant access to the PDF guide + habit tracker.
  You'll also receive a free voucher to use the program in our mobile app.
</p>
```

**Why this works:**
- Clear: PDF is instant, app voucher is bonus
- Removes distracting link to Swae landing page
- Simpler language ("free" vs. "limited-time discounted")

---

### 2. Pricing Section is Contradictory ‚ùå

**Current state:**
- Line 386: Price shows `$0` with strikethrough `$79`
- Line 388: Says "Limited time"
- Line 401: Button says "Download the PDF + Tracker (Free)"
- Line 401: Below button: "Mock checkout ‚Äî button for design only"

**Then immediately below:**
- Second offer: `$19` (Premium bundle)
- Line 434: Button says "Coming soon"
- Line 436: "Mock layout ‚Äî checkout coming later"

**Problem:**
- User is confused: Is it free or $79 or $19?
- "Mock checkout" note destroys trust
- Why show two offers if neither is real?

**Fix Option A (Waitlist Mode - Before Validation):**

Remove both pricing sections entirely. Replace with single CTA:

```tsx
<section className="py-24 px-4 bg-emerald-50">
  <div className="max-w-4xl mx-auto text-center">
    <h2 className="text-4xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">
      Be the first to get UYE
    </h2>
    <p className="text-xl text-gray-600 mb-8">
      Join the waitlist and get early access pricing (over 50% off) when we launch.
    </p>
    <div className="max-w-md mx-auto">
      <EmailCapture />
    </div>
    <p className="text-sm text-gray-500 mt-4">
      Expected launch: December 2025. Early access includes PDF + mobile app + email support.
    </p>
  </div>
</section>
```

**Fix Option B (Pre-Order Mode - After Reddit Validation):**

If beta testing shows demand, switch to single pre-order offer:

```tsx
<section className="py-24 px-4">
  <div className="max-w-4xl mx-auto">
    <div className="rounded-3xl border-2 border-emerald-500 bg-white shadow-xl overflow-hidden">
      <div className="p-10 text-center">
        <div className="inline-flex items-center gap-2 px-4 py-2 bg-emerald-100 text-emerald-800 rounded-full text-sm mb-6">
          <Tag className="w-4 h-4" /> Early Access Offer
        </div>
        <h3 className="text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">
          Unf*ck Your Eating ‚Äî Complete Program
        </h3>
        <p className="text-xl text-gray-600 mb-6">
          PDF guide + mobile app access + 8 weeks of email support
        </p>
        <div className="flex items-center justify-center gap-3 mb-8">
          <div className="text-5xl font-extrabold text-gray-900">$20</div>
          <div className="text-gray-400 line-through text-2xl">$49</div>
        </div>
        <button
          onClick={() => {/* Stripe checkout */}}
          className="w-full max-w-md px-8 py-4 bg-emerald-600 hover:bg-emerald-700 text-white text-lg font-semibold rounded-xl transition-colors inline-flex items-center justify-center gap-2 mb-6"
        >
          <CreditCard className="w-5 h-5" /> Get Instant Access
        </button>
        <div className="space-y-2 text-sm text-gray-600 text-left max-w-md mx-auto">
          <div className="flex items-center gap-2">
            <Check className="w-4 h-4 text-emerald-600 flex-shrink-0" />
            PDF guide delivered instantly via email
          </div>
          <div className="flex items-center gap-2">
            <Check className="w-4 h-4 text-emerald-600 flex-shrink-0" />
            Mobile app access (iOS, Android, Web)
          </div>
          <div className="flex items-center gap-2">
            <Check className="w-4 h-4 text-emerald-600 flex-shrink-0" />
            8 weeks of daily lessons + habit tracking
          </div>
          <div className="flex items-center gap-2">
            <Check className="w-4 h-4 text-emerald-600 flex-shrink-0" />
            Email support (replies within 24 hours)
          </div>
        </div>
        <p className="text-xs text-gray-500 mt-6">
          30-day money-back guarantee. No questions asked.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</section>
```

**Recommendation:** Use Option A (waitlist) until you validate with $500 ad test + Reddit beta. Then switch to Option B (pre-order) when you're ready to collect money.

### 3. Founder Story is Buried üí°

**Current:**
- Line 98-101: Founder story is in paragraph 3 of "We've been there too" section
- Easy to miss

**Fix:**
Add a dedicated "About the Founder" section with photo:

```tsx
<section className="py-16 px-4 bg-gray-50">
  <div className="max-w-4xl mx-auto">
    <div className="flex flex-col md:flex-row gap-8 items-center">
      <img
        src="/images/founder-photo.jpg"
        alt="Founder name"
        className="w-48 h-48 rounded-2xl object-cover shadow-lg"
      />
      <div>
        <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3">
          Built by someone who gets it
        </h3>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-3">
          I lost over 100 lbs using these exact habits. Not overnight. Not by starving.
          By stacking small wins until they became a life.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
          I built UYE because I was tired of the all-or-nothing BS that burns people out.
          This is the program I wish I had when I started.
        </p>
        <p className="text-gray-600 mt-3 font-medium">
          ‚Äî [Your Name], Founder
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</section>
```

**Why this works:**
- Builds trust (real person, real story)
- Differentiates from faceless corporate programs
- 100 lbs weight loss is a powerful proof point

---

### 4. FAQ Could Be Stronger üí°

**Current FAQs are good but missing key objections:**

**Add these questions:**

```tsx
{
  q: 'How is this different from other habit programs?',
  a: 'Most programs give you habits but no support system. UYE includes daily lessons, app-based tracking, and (optional) email check-ins. Plus, it's based on Precision Nutrition's proven methodology, not someone's Instagram course.'
},
{
  q: 'What if I've tried everything and nothing works?',
  a: 'If restrictive diets haven't worked, that's not a you problem‚Äîit's a method problem. UYE doesn't restrict. It teaches skills. You're not "failing" if you miss a day. You're building resilience.'
},
{
  q: 'Do I need the app or is the PDF enough?',
  a: 'The PDF gives you the content. The app makes it easier to stay consistent (automated reminders, progress tracking, habit check-ins). Most people find the app more effective, but you can succeed with just the PDF if you're disciplined.'
},
```

---

### 5. Social Proof Needs Specificity üí°

**Current testimonials (lines 206-212) are generic:**
- "Meals stopped being a battle. I actually have energy after work."
- "I got out of the all-or-nothing loop. Small wins, big results."

**Problem:**
- Vague results ("energy," "small wins")
- No context (how long did it take? what was their struggle?)

**Fix (after beta testing):**
Replace with specific testimonials:

```tsx
{
  name: 'Jordan M. ‚Ä¢ Busy Parent',
  quote: 'After 4 weeks, I stopped binge eating at night. The "eat slowly" habit literally changed my relationship with snacking. Down 8 lbs without counting a single calorie.',
  result: '8 lbs lost, stopped binge eating'
},
{
  name: 'Riley K. ‚Ä¢ Startup Founder',
  quote: 'I thought I didn't have time for this. Turns out 10 minutes a day was all I needed. Went from eating takeout 6x/week to cooking 4x/week. Feel way better.',
  result: 'Improved energy, better food choices'
},
{
  name: 'Sam T. ‚Ä¢ Former Athlete',
  quote: 'I was stuck in the bulk/cut cycle for years. UYE taught me to eat like a normal person again. Lost 15 lbs of fat, kept all my strength. Game changer.',
  result: '15 lbs lost, maintained strength'
},
```

**Why this works:**
- Specific outcomes (8 lbs, stopped binge eating, 4 weeks)
- Relatable struggles (busy parent, startup founder, athlete)
- Realistic timeframes (not "lose 50 lbs in 2 weeks" BS)

---

## Medium-Priority Changes

### 6. Email Capture Success Message Could Be Better

**Current (line 34):**
```tsx
<span className="font-medium">Check your email to verify and get your PDF + tracker.</span>
```

**Problem:**
- This implies they're getting the PDF immediately, but they're not (it's a waitlist)
- "Verify" adds friction

**Fix:**
```tsx
<span className="font-medium">
  You're on the list! Check your email for next steps.
</span>
```

---

### 7. "What You'll Learn" Section is Too Low

**Current:**
- Line 445-471: This section is near the bottom
- It's valuable content but buried

**Fix:**
- Move it to right after "There's a better way" section (after line 278)
- People want to know WHAT they're getting before they see testimonials

---

### 8. Bottom CTA Could Be More Urgent

**Current (line 492):**
```tsx
<h2>Get the UYE PDF + Tracker free</h2>
<p>Start today. Everyone who signs up will get a discounted Swae voucher when it's ready...</p>
```

**Problem:**
- "When it's ready" kills urgency
- "Discounted Swae voucher" is confusing (what's Swae? how much discount?)

**Fix:**
```tsx
<h2 className="text-4xl sm:text-5xl font-bold text-white mb-6">
  Ready to un-f*ck your eating?
</h2>
<p className="text-xl text-emerald-100 mb-10 max-w-2xl mx-auto">
  Join the waitlist and be the first to know when UYE launches.
  Early access pricing will be 50% off (one time only).
</p>
```

---

## Low-Priority Polish

### 9. Header CTA Button

**Current (line 60):**
```tsx
<a href="#get" className="...">Get the PDF</a>
```

**Better:**
```tsx
<a href="#get" className="...">Join Waitlist</a>
```
(Matches what they're actually doing)

---

### 10. Footer Link

**Current (line 505-513):**
- Footer has MindMirror-style logo/branding
- Says "A Swae OS project"

**Fix:**
- Remove "Swae OS" reference until Swae has its own landing page live
- Keep it focused on UYE brand

---
