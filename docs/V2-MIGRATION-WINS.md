# What Cloud Run v2 Unlocks - Quick Wins

## ✅ Practices Service v2 Migration Complete

The practices_service is now on Cloud Run v2! Here's what we can now implement **quickly** across all services.

---

## 🎯 Immediate Hardening Wins (After Full v2 Migration)

### 1. Secret Volume Mounts (CRITICAL - Week 1)
**Time**: 1-2 days for all services
**Difficulty**: ⭐⭐ Medium
**Impact**: 🔥 HIGH - Secrets never exposed in Terraform or Cloud Console

**What it unlocks**:
```hcl
# Instead of this (secrets visible in state/console):
env {
  name  = "DATABASE_URL"
  value = var.database_url  # EXPOSED in Terraform state!
}

# We can do this (secrets mounted as files):
volumes {
  name = "db-secret"
  secret {
    secret = "DATABASE_URL"
    items {
      version = "latest"
      path    = "database_url"
    }
  }
}

containers {
  volume_mounts {
    name       = "db-secret"
    mount_path = "/secrets"
  }
}
```

**Application changes needed**:
```python
# Update shared/secrets.py to support file-based secrets
def get_database_url():
    # Try file first (production)
    if os.path.exists("/secrets/database_url"):
        return Path("/secrets/database_url").read_text().strip()
    # Fallback to env var (local dev)
    return os.getenv("DATABASE_URL")
```

**Services to update**:
- ✅ practices_service (v2 ready)
- [ ] movements_service
- [ ] users_service
- [ ] meals_service
- [ ] habits_service
- [ ] journal_service
- [ ] agent_service
- [ ] gateway
- [ ] celery_worker

### 2. Health Probes (QUICK - Week 1)
**Time**: 1 hour (already implemented in practices_service!)
**Difficulty**: ⭐ Easy
**Impact**: 🔥 HIGH - Better reliability, faster failure detection

**Already implemented**:
```hcl
startup_probe {
  http_get {
    path = "/health"
    port = 8000
  }
  initial_delay_seconds = 10
  timeout_seconds       = 3
  period_seconds        = 10
  failure_threshold     = 3
}

liveness_probe {
  http_get {
    path = "/health"
    port = 8000
  }
  initial_delay_seconds = 30
  period_seconds        = 30
  failure_threshold     = 3
}
```

**What it gives us**:
- ✅ Faster detection of unhealthy instances (30s vs 5 min)
- ✅ Automatic restart of failing containers
- ✅ Better uptime metrics
- ✅ Prevents serving traffic to unhealthy instances

**Next step**: Just copy this to all other services after v2 migration.

### 3. Better Resource Controls (QUICK - Week 1)
**Time**: 30 minutes
**Difficulty**: ⭐ Easy
**Impact**: 💰 MEDIUM - Cost savings + performance

**Already implemented in practices_service**:
```hcl
resources {
  limits = {
    cpu    = "1000m"  # v2 millicpu notation
    memory = "512Mi"
  }
  cpu_idle          = true   # CPU throttling when idle (cost savings)
  startup_cpu_boost = false  # Can enable for faster cold starts
}
```

**What we can tune per service**:
- `cpu_idle = true`: Save money when service is idle
- `startup_cpu_boost = true`: Faster cold starts for latency-sensitive services
- Fine-grained CPU allocation (100m, 250m, 500m, 1000m, 2000m, 4000m)

---

### 4. Improved Scaling (QUICK - Week 1)
**Time**: 15 minutes
**Difficulty**: ⭐ Easy
**Impact**: 💰 MEDIUM - Better cost control

**Already implemented**:
```hcl
scaling {
  min_instance_count = 1   # Keep warm for low latency
  max_instance_count = 10  # Prevent runaway costs
}
```

**Per-environment tuning**:
```hcl
# Staging (cost-optimized)
min_instance_count = 0  # Scale to zero when idle
max_instance_count = 5  # Lower ceiling

# Production (performance-optimized)
min_instance_count = 1  # Always warm
max_instance_count = 20 # Handle traffic spikes
```

---

## 🔐 Security Hardening Unlocked

### Phase 2 Items (After All Services on v2)

#### A. Internal-Only Backend Services (Week 2)
**Enabled by**: v2 ingress controls
**Time**: 2-3 hours
**Difficulty**: ⭐⭐ Medium

```hcl
# Backend services (agent, journal, habits, etc.)
ingress = "INGRESS_TRAFFIC_INTERNAL_ONLY"

# Gateway only
ingress = "INGRESS_TRAFFIC_ALL"
```

**Result**: Backend services have NO public URL at all. Only gateway can call them.

#### B. VPC Egress Control (Week 2-3)
**Enabled by**: v2 vpc_access block
**Time**: 4-6 hours
**Difficulty**: ⭐⭐⭐ Complex

```hcl
vpc_access {
  connector = "projects/PROJECT/locations/REGION/connectors/connector"
  egress    = "PRIVATE_RANGES_ONLY"
}
```

**Result**:
- Internal traffic goes through VPC (faster, more secure)
- External APIs (Supabase, OpenAI) still accessible via internet
- Can add Cloud SQL, Redis in VPC later

## 🎁 Bonus Features We Get "For Free"

### 1. Direct Secret Manager References (v2 only)
Instead of passing secrets through Terraform:
```hcl
env {
  name = "OPENAI_API_KEY"
  value_source {
    secret_key_ref {
      secret  = "OPENAI_API_KEY"
      version = "latest"
    }
  }
}
```

**Benefit**: Secrets auto-rotate when updated in Secret Manager (no redeploy needed).

### 2. Execution Environment Labels
```hcl
labels = {
  managed-by = "terraform"
  service    = "practices"
  env        = var.environment
  version    = "v2"
}
```

**Benefit**: Better filtering in Cloud Console, cost tracking, monitoring.

### 3. Better Timeout Control
```hcl
timeout = "300s"  # Per-service request timeout
```

**Benefit**: Prevent long-running requests from blocking instances.

### 4. Multi-Container Support (Future)
v2 supports sidecars for:
- Cloud SQL Proxy (database connections)
- Envoy proxy (service mesh)
- Log forwarders
- Background workers
