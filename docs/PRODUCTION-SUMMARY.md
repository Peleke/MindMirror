# Production Deployment - Quick Summary üéØ

**Status:** ‚úÖ Ready for staging test tomorrow ‚Üí Production after Vercel

---

## What Was Fixed Just Now üîß

### 1. Critical Issue: Missing Terraform Outputs ‚úÖ FIXED
**File:** `infra/outputs.tf`
**Added:**
- `meals_service_url`
- `movements_service_url`
- `practices_service_url`
- `users_service_url`

**Why:** Gateway rebuild scripts expect all 7 service URLs. Without these, extraction would fail.

### 2. Production Readiness Checklist ‚úÖ CREATED
**File:** `docs/PRODUCTION-READINESS-CHECKLIST.md` (665 lines)
**Contains:**
- All missing pieces for production deployment
- GCP configuration steps
- Workflow creation instructions
- Deployment runbook
- Rollback strategy

## What You Need to Do üìã

### Tomorrow: Staging Test
1. ‚úÖ Test end-to-end deployment on staging
2. ‚úÖ Verify all 7 service URLs extracted correctly
3. ‚úÖ Verify gateway builds with service URLs
4. ‚úÖ Verify gateway deploys and health checks pass
5. ‚úÖ Test GraphQL queries through gateway

### Before Production: Create 4 Workflows

**1. Modify `production-deploy.yml`**
- Exclude `mesh_gateway` from build matrix
- Same as staging exclusion pattern

**2. Modify `tofu-apply-production.yml`**
- Add `extract-service-urls` job
- Save URLs to `service-urls-production` secret

**3. Create `gateway-deploy-production.yml`**
- Manual trigger only (no auto-trigger)
- Uses `mindmirror-prod` project
- Fetches from `service-urls-production`

**4. Create `tofu-apply-gateway-production.yml`**
- Manual trigger with approval gate
- Uses GitHub Environment protection
- More comprehensive health checks

### GCP Setup Required

**Staging (Already Configured):**
- Secret: `service-urls-staging` in mindmirror-69
- IAM permissions for github-actions-staging

**Production (Need to Create):**
```bash
# Create production secret
gcloud secrets create service-urls-production \
  --project=mindmirror-prod \
  --replication-policy="automatic"

# Grant IAM permissions
gcloud secrets add-iam-policy-binding service-urls-production \
  --project=mindmirror-prod \
  --member="serviceAccount:github-actions-production@mindmirror-prod.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
  --role="roles/secretmanager.admin"

gcloud secrets add-iam-policy-binding service-urls-production \
  --project=mindmirror-prod \
  --member="serviceAccount:github-actions-production@mindmirror-prod.iam.gserviceaccount.com" \
  --role="roles/secretmanager.secretAccessor"
```

## Deployment Flow Comparison

### Staging (Automated) ‚ö°
```
Push ‚Üí Services build ‚Üí Services deploy ‚Üí URLs extracted ‚Üí Gateway builds ‚Üí Gateway deploys
       (2-5 min)        (3-5 min)         (1 min)         (3-5 min)        (2-3 min)
Total: ~15-20 minutes, fully automated
```

### Production (Controlled) üõ°Ô∏è
```
Merge ‚Üí PR created ‚Üí Review + Approve ‚Üí Services deploy ‚Üí URLs extracted
        (instant)    (manual)           (3-5 min)        (1 min)
           ‚Üì
Manual trigger gateway build ‚Üí Review ‚Üí Manual trigger gateway deploy ‚Üí Approval gate ‚Üí Deploy
(3-5 min)                       (manual) (instant)                       (manual)       (2-3 min)

Total: ~20-30 minutes + manual review time
```

## Key Differences: Staging vs Production

| Aspect | Staging | Production |
|--------|---------|------------|
| **Services Deploy** | Auto on push | PR + manual approval |
| **Gateway Build** | Auto-triggered | Manual trigger only |
| **Gateway Deploy** | Auto-approved | Approval gate required |
| **Rollback** | Automatic | Manual, planned |
| **Testing** | Automated only | Manual validation too |

---

## Timeline ‚è∞

**Tomorrow (Day 1):**
- Test staging end-to-end
- Verify all scripts work correctly
- Confirm gateway federation works

**After Vercel Cutover (Day 2-3):**
- Create 4 production workflows
- Set up production Secret Manager
- Configure GitHub environment protection
- Deploy to production

**Production Deployment:**
- Merge to main ‚Üí Services deploy (20-30 min)
- Manual gateway build + review (5 min)
- Manual gateway deploy + approval (5 min)
- Post-deployment validation (30 min)
- **Total: ~1 hour**

---

## Risk Mitigation üõ°Ô∏è

**What Could Go Wrong:**
1. Service URLs not extracted ‚Üí Gateway build fails
   - **Fix:** Re-run extract job manually
2. Gateway build fails ‚Üí Services still work fine
   - **Fix:** Investigate, rebuild, no service impact
3. Gateway deploy fails ‚Üí Rollback to previous revision
   - **Fix:** Cloud Run keeps previous revisions, instant rollback
4. Performance issues ‚Üí Gradual rollout
   - **Fix:** Cloud Run traffic splitting (10% ‚Üí 50% ‚Üí 100%)

**Safety Net:**
- Two-phase deployment means gateway failure doesn't affect services
- Services continue running on old gateway until new one is ready
- Can rollback gateway independently
- Staging is identical to production (confidence high)

## Quick Reference Commands üöÄ

### Test Staging Tomorrow
```bash
# Trigger staging deployment
git push origin workflow:staging

# Watch workflows
gh run watch

# Check gateway health
curl https://gateway-staging-xxx.run.app/healthcheck | jq '.'

# Test GraphQL
curl -X POST https://gateway-staging-xxx.run.app/graphql \

  --secret=service-urls-production \
  --project=mindmirror-prod | jq '.'
```

### Monitor Deployments
```bash
# GitHub Actions
gh run list --workflow=staging-deploy.yml --limit=5

# Cloud Run services
gcloud run services list --project=mindmirror-69 --region=us-east4

# Gateway logs
