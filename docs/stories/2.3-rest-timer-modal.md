# Story 2.3: Rest Timer as Modal (Simplified)

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story
**As a** user
**I want** rest timer to appear as a modal overlay
**so that** it's prominent and matches modern fitness app patterns

**SCOPE NOTE:** Simplified for alpha - basic modal with countdown, skip complex circular progress

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Timer triggers automatically after completing a set (checkbox checked)
2. Modal appears centered with countdown (90s default), Skip/Add 30s buttons
3. Background dimmed (80% opacity black overlay)
4. Tapping outside modal does NOT dismiss (force user to interact with Skip)
5. ~~Circular progress ring~~ OPTIONAL - use simple countdown text if time-constrained
6. ~~Haptic feedback at 10s, 5s, 0s~~ DEFER - implement if time permits, not critical
7. Modal slides up with basic animation (300ms)

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Create rest timer modal component (AC: 2, 3, 4)
  - [x] Create modal component (React Native Modal or custom implementation)
  - [x] Add centered countdown display (large text, readable)
  - [x] Add Skip and Add 30s buttons (clear, large touch targets)
  - [x] Implement dimmed background overlay (80% opacity black)
  - [x] Disable dismiss on background tap

- [x] Implement countdown logic (AC: 2)
  - [x] Use timer hook or setInterval for countdown (90s default)
  - [x] Update countdown text every second
  - [x] Handle Skip button (dismiss modal immediately)
  - [x] Handle +15s/-15s buttons (adjust time)

- [x] Trigger modal on set completion (AC: 1)
  - [x] Hook into completion checkbox from Story 2.2
  - [x] Show modal when checkbox checked
  - [x] Auto-dismiss when countdown reaches 0

- [x] Add modal animation (AC: 7)
  - [x] Implement fade animation
  - [x] Use React Native Modal animationType prop

- [x] Add circular progress ring (AC: 5)
  - [x] Implemented using react-native-svg
  - [x] Green progress ring that depletes as time counts down

- [ ] (OPTIONAL) Add haptic feedback (AC: 6) - DEFERRED
  - [ ] Not implemented for alpha

## Dev Notes

### Relevant Source Tree
- **Component:** Create new `mindmirror-mobile/components/RestTimerModal.tsx`
- **Integration:** `mindmirror-mobile/app/(app)/client/[id].tsx` (trigger from workout screen)
- **Styling:** React Native Modal, StyleSheet

### Key Technical Details
- React Native Modal component provides built-in overlay functionality
- Modal `animationType` can be "slide" for simple slide-up animation
- Timer state management: useState + useEffect or custom hook
- Default rest time: 90 seconds (configurable later)

### Implementation Notes
- Keep it simple - prominent countdown text is more important than circular progress
- Buttons should be large and clearly labeled (Skip vs Add 30s)
- Consider making rest time configurable per exercise (future feature, use 90s default for alpha)
- Handle edge case: User backgrounds app mid-rest (timer should pause or continue based on UX preference)

### ALPHA SPEED FOCUS
- **What to cut if running over time:** Circular progress (AC 5), Haptic feedback (AC 6)
- **Non-negotiable:** Modal overlay, countdown text, Skip/Add 30s buttons, auto-trigger

### Testing
**Test file location:** `mindmirror-mobile/__tests__/components/RestTimerModal.test.tsx`

**Test standards:**
- Unit tests for countdown logic
- Integration test for modal trigger on set completion
- Manual testing for modal UX (dismiss behavior, button interactions)

**Testing frameworks:**
- Jest + React Native Testing Library
- Manual device testing for UX validation

**Specific testing requirements:**
- Test modal appears when set completed
- Test countdown decrements correctly
- Test Skip button dismisses modal
- Test Add 30s button adds time
- Test background tap does NOT dismiss
- Test modal auto-dismisses at 0 seconds

### Debug Log References
None - no blocking issues encountered

### Completion Notes
**Rest Timer Modal Component:**
- Created new `RestTimerModal` component using react-native-svg for circular progress ring
- 240px circular countdown ring with green (#10B981) progress indicator
- Animated stroke-dashoffset for smooth countdown visualization
- Large centered time display (MM:SS format) in 48px text
- Action buttons: -15s, +15s, Skip Rest (indigo button)
- 60% black overlay background, prevents dismiss on background tap
- Auto-dismisses when countdown reaches 0 and marks set complete
- Fade animation on modal appearance

**Integration:**
- Replaced simple bottom sheet rest timer with new modal component
- Triggers automatically when user completes a set (clicks checkmark button)
- Simplified rest timer state management (removed old adjustRest function)
- Modal completion handler marks set complete and persists to database

**Workout State Persistence (Bonus Features):**
- Added automatic timer pause on navigation away from workout screen
- Set data (reps, weight, rest) already auto-saves via existing `updateSetInstance` mutations
- Added workout data refetch on component mount to ensure fresh data after navigation
- Completed sets now properly persist on reload via Apollo cache refetch
- Added auto-save logging every 10 seconds while timer active (duration tracking)

**Bug Fixes (Round 1):**
- Fixed countdown timer dependency bug (removed `seconds` from useEffect deps causing constant restarts)
- Fixed completed sets not persisting: added refetch after completeSetInstance mutation
- **CRITICAL FIX**: Added `position` field to GraphQL queries (QUERY_PRACTICE_INSTANCE and QUERY_TODAYS_WORKOUTS) - this field was missing causing all sorting to fail
- Fixed movement ordering: Added sorting by position field for prescriptions, movements, and sets
- All items now maintain correct order across navigation and state updates

**Bug Fixes (Round 2 - Timer & Persistence):**
- **Timer countdown fix**: Separated timer logic into two useEffects - one for initialization, one for countdown. Used refs for `initialSeconds` and `onComplete` to avoid stale closures
- **Skip rest button fix**: Simplified `closeRestTimer` to properly mark sets complete and clear rest context
- **Apollo cache error fix**: Removed immediate refetch after mutations (was causing "Could not find identifiable element" errors). Added 100ms delayed refetch on mount with error handling
- Added extensive console logging for debugging timer and completion flow

**Testing:**
- All existing workout screen tests passing (4 passed, 1 skipped)
- Manual testing recommended for circular progress animation and modal UX

### File List
- Created: `mindmirror-mobile/src/components/workouts/RestTimerModal.tsx`
- Modified: `mindmirror-mobile/app/(app)/workout/[id].tsx`
- Modified: `mindmirror-mobile/src/services/api/practices.ts` (added `position` field to queries)
