# Story 2.5: Minimal Visual Polish (Alpha Essentials Only)

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** user
**I want** workout screen to feel clean and professional
**so that** I'm not distracted by broken layouts or unreadable text

**SCOPE NOTE:** HEAVILY REDUCED - skip design tokens, skeleton screens, animation library. Focus: Fix obvious visual bugs only.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Typography: Consistent font sizes and weights (system fonts only)
2. Spacing: Consistent padding/margins (use simple 8px/16px/24px scale)
3. Colors: Readable text contrast (dark text on light background, no eye strain)
4. ~~Shadows/elevation~~ DEFER - not critical for alpha
5. ~~Animations (fade-in, slide-up)~~ DEFER - covered minimally in 2.1, 2.3
6. ~~Loading states (skeleton screens)~~ DEFER - simple spinners acceptable
7. Basic responsiveness (works on common screen sizes, no layout breaks)

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Audit current workout screen for visual bugs (AC: All)
  - [ ] Check typography for inconsistencies (mixed font sizes, weights)
  - [ ] Check spacing for layout issues (overlapping elements, cramped UI)
  - [ ] Check color contrast (ensure text is readable)
  - [ ] Test on multiple screen sizes (iPhone SE, iPhone 14, Android devices)

- [ ] Apply consistent typography (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Use system fonts (SF Pro on iOS, Roboto on Android)
  - [ ] Standardize heading sizes (24px for headers, 16px for body)
  - [ ] Use appropriate font weights (bold for headings, regular for body)

- [ ] Apply consistent spacing (AC: 2)
  - [ ] Use simple spacing scale: 8px, 16px, 24px
  - [ ] Fix any cramped or overlapping elements
  - [ ] Ensure touch targets are 44px minimum (iOS HIG)

- [ ] Fix color contrast issues (AC: 3)
  - [ ] Ensure text is dark enough on light backgrounds (avoid light gray on white)
  - [ ] Use simple color palette: Black/dark gray for text, white for background, blue for primary actions, green for success
  - [ ] Avoid bright or saturated colors that cause eye strain

- [ ] Test responsiveness (AC: 7)
  - [ ] Test on small screens (iPhone SE, smaller Android devices)
  - [ ] Test on large screens (iPhone 14 Pro Max, tablets if applicable)
  - [ ] Fix any layout breaks or horizontal scrolling issues

## Dev Notes

### Relevant Source Tree
- **Component:** `mindmirror-mobile/app/(app)/client/[id].tsx` (workout screen)
- **Styling:** React Native StyleSheet (inline styles acceptable for quick fixes)

### Key Technical Details
- This is a "cleanup" story - fix obvious visual bugs without over-engineering
- Use inline styles or existing StyleSheet patterns
- **NO NEW LIBRARIES** - work with what's already in the project
- Focus on "good enough for alpha" not "production-ready design system"

### Implementation Notes
- System fonts: StyleSheet `fontFamily: Platform.OS === 'ios' ? 'System' : 'Roboto'`
- Spacing: Use StyleSheet with margin/padding values (8, 16, 24)
- Colors: Define simple constants at top of file if needed
- Avoid creating global theme files (defer to post-alpha)

### ALPHA SPEED FOCUS
- **Time cap:** 1 hour maximum
- **What to cut:** Anything beyond basic cleanup (shadows, animations, skeleton screens)
- **Non-negotiable:** Readable text, consistent spacing, no layout breaks

### Testing
**Test file location:** Manual visual testing (no automated tests required)

**Test standards:**
- Manual visual inspection on iOS and Android
- Screenshot comparison before/after (save in docs/testing/ for reference)

**Testing frameworks:**
- Manual device testing only
- No automated visual regression tests for alpha

**Specific testing requirements:**
- Visual inspection: Typography looks consistent
- Visual inspection: Spacing is not cramped or overlapping
- Visual inspection: Text is readable (high contrast)
- Manual testing: No layout breaks on different screen sizes
