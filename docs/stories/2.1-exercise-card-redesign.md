# Story 2.1: Exercise Card Redesign (Simplified for Alpha)

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** user
**I want** exercise cards to display name and target sets/reps prominently
**so that** I immediately understand what exercise to perform

**SCOPE NOTE:** Simplified for alpha speed - defer GIF demos, accordion notes, complex transitions

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Card layout: Exercise name (24px bold) at top, target sets/reps below in secondary text (16px)
2. Card elevation: 2dp shadow, white background, 8px rounded corners
3. Spacing: 16px padding, 24px margin between cards
4. Smooth fade-in transition (200ms ease-in-out) when cards render
5. ~~GIF thumbnail~~ DEFERRED - use placeholder icon or omit entirely
6. ~~Exercise notes accordion~~ DEFERRED - notes not critical for alpha
7. ~~Full-screen GIF demo view~~ DEFERRED - implement post-alpha

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Update exercise card component (AC: 1, 2, 3)
  - [ ] Locate component in `mindmirror-mobile/app/(app)/client/[id].tsx`
  - [ ] Update layout: Exercise name at top (24px bold), target sets/reps below (16px)
  - [ ] Apply card styling: 2dp shadow, white background, 8px rounded corners
  - [ ] Set padding/margin: 16px internal, 24px between cards

- [ ] Add simple fade-in animation (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Use React Native Animated API or Reanimated (lightweight approach)
  - [ ] Implement 200ms ease-in-out fade when exercises load

- [ ] Test on iOS and Android (AC: All)
  - [ ] Verify layout renders correctly on both platforms
  - [ ] Test with long exercise names (overflow handling)
  - [ ] Verify spacing is consistent

## Dev Notes

### Relevant Source Tree
- **Component:** `mindmirror-mobile/app/(app)/client/[id].tsx` (workout screen)
- **Styling:** Likely using StyleSheet or styled-components
- **Animation:** React Native Animated API or Reanimated library

### Key Technical Details
- Current implementation is functional but lacks visual polish
- Focus on readability and clean layout, not pixel-perfect Hevy clone
- Defer GIF demos (assets may not be available, not critical for alpha)
- Keep implementation simple to stay within 2-hour estimate

### Implementation Notes
- Use React Native StyleSheet for consistent styling
- Typography: System fonts (SF Pro on iOS, Roboto on Android)
- Colors: Keep it simple - use existing theme or basic grays/blues
- Animation: Use Animated.FadeIn if available, otherwise skip animation to save time

### ALPHA SPEED FOCUS
- **What to cut if running over time:** Animation (AC 4)
- **Non-negotiable:** Clear exercise name, readable target sets/reps, clean spacing

### Testing
**Test file location:** `mindmirror-mobile/__tests__/client/exercise-card.test.tsx`

**Test standards:**
- Snapshot tests for component rendering
- Visual regression tests (optional, use Storybook if available)
- Manual testing on iOS and Android devices

**Testing frameworks:**
- Jest + React Native Testing Library
- Detox/Maestro E2E (defer to Story 4.2)

**Specific testing requirements:**
- Test exercise card renders with correct exercise name
- Test target sets/reps display correctly
- Test card spacing/padding visual consistency
- Test on both iOS and Android (manual testing acceptable for alpha)
