## Template 1: r/loseit (Weight Loss Community)

**Title:** [Beta Test] Free 8-week mindful eating program - looking for 10 testers

**Body:**

Hey r/loseit,

I built an 8-week program to help people develop a healthier relationship with food without obsessive tracking or restriction. It's based on Precision Nutrition's habit-first coaching method (the same approach that helped me lose 100+ lbs sustainably).

**What it is:**
- 7 simple habits, introduced one per week (eat slowly, stop at 80% full, prioritize protein, etc.)
- Daily lessons to explain the "why" and keep you motivated
- Simple tracker for consistency (not perfection)
- Delivered through a mobile app (iOS/Android/web)

**What it's NOT:**
- No calorie counting or macro tracking
- No "good" or "bad" foods
- No shame or guilt trips

I just finished testing with 2 early users and got positive feedback. Now I'm looking for **10 more people** to beta test before I launch publicly.

**What you get:**
- Free access to the full 8-week program (normally $20)
- Direct line to me for questions/support
- Your feedback will shape the final product

**What I need from you:**
- Complete at least 50% of the program (4 weeks minimum)
- Give me honest feedback (via quick weekly check-ins)
- Let me know what works, what's confusing, what's missing

If you're interested, **comment below or DM me**. I'll send you a signup link within 24 hours.

## Template 2: r/EatCheapAndHealthy (Budget-Conscious Eaters)

**Title:** Beta testing a mindful eating program - no macros, no expensive meal plans, just habits

**Body:**

I built a program to help people eat better without all the BS that makes "healthy eating" feel impossible on a budget.

**The approach:**
- One habit per week for 8 weeks (eat slowly, prioritize whole foods, rethink drinks, etc.)
- Works with foods you already eat - no fancy ingredients or meal prep Sundays required
- Simple daily lessons (5-10 min read) with practical tips

**Why I'm sharing here:**
This community gets it - eating well shouldn't require a personal chef or a Whole Foods budget. The habits in this program work with whatever you can afford. No judgment, no "eat organic or don't bother" nonsense.

**I'm looking for 10 beta testers** before I launch publicly. It's completely free (normally $20), delivered through a mobile app.

**What I need:**
- Try to complete at least 4 weeks of the program
- Give me feedback on what's helpful vs. what's not
- Let me know if the habits feel realistic for your life

**Comment or DM if you're interested.** I'll send you a signup link.

## Template 3: r/fitness (General Fitness Community)

**Title:** [Beta Test] Habit-based nutrition program (8 weeks, free) - looking for testers

**Body:**

If you train consistently but your nutrition is chaos, this might help.

I built an 8-week program focused on building sustainable eating habits - the stuff that actually matters for performance and body composition, without obsessive tracking.

**The 7 habits:**
1. Eat without distractions (TV, phone)
2. Eat slowly and chew thoroughly
3. Stop at 80% full
4. Prioritize fiber (fruits, veggies, grains)
5. Prioritize protein
6. Choose water over sugary drinks
7. Prefer whole foods over processed

**Why this approach:**
Based on Precision Nutrition's coaching methodology. Same principles I used to lose 100+ lbs while building strength. It's not sexy, but it works long-term.

**Beta test details:**
- Delivered through a mobile app (habits + daily lessons)
- Completely free (normally $20)
- I need 10 testers to complete at least 4 weeks and give feedback

**If you're interested:** Comment or DM. I'll send a signup link within 24 hours.

## Template 4: r/intuitiveeating (Anti-Diet Community)

**Title:** Testing a non-diet habit program - focus on cues, not rules

**Body:**

I built something that might resonate with this community - an 8-week program focused on reconnecting with hunger/fullness cues and building sustainable habits.

**The philosophy:**
- No calorie counting, no macros, no "forbidden" foods
- Focus on awareness: eating slowly, noticing fullness, reducing distractions
- Gentle guidance (fiber, protein, whole foods) without rigid rules
- Rooted in behavior change research, not diet culture

**Why I'm sharing:**
I know this community is skeptical of "programs" (and rightfully so). This isn't about weight loss as a goal - it's about building a better relationship with food. Some people lose weight, some don't. The focus is on developing skills that last.

**I'm looking for 10 beta testers:**
- Free access through a mobile app
- Complete at least 4 weeks, give honest feedback
- Help me make sure the messaging stays aligned with intuitive eating principles (no diet culture BS)

**Comment or DM if this sounds aligned with your goals.** I'll send a signup link.

## Template 5: r/xxfitness (Women's Fitness Community)

**Title:** [Beta] 8-week mindful eating program - habit-first, no restriction

**Body:**

Building sustainable eating habits is hard. Diet culture makes it harder.

I built an 8-week program that ditches the all-or-nothing rules and focuses on practical habits:
- Eat without distractions
- Eat slowly, stop at 80% full
- Prioritize protein and fiber
- Choose water over sugary drinks
- Prefer whole foods

**What makes it different:**
- No calorie counting or macro tracking (unless YOU want to)
- No guilt or shame if you miss a day
- Daily lessons explain the "why" with evidence, not fear-mongering
- Fits into real life (travel, periods, stress, socializing)

**I just tested this with 2 users** and now I'm looking for **10 more beta testers** before launch.

**What you get:**
- Free access (normally $20)
- Mobile app delivery (iOS/Android/web)
- Direct support from me

**What I need:**
- Complete at least 4 weeks
- Give me feedback on what works/doesn't
- Let me know if anything feels off or diet-culture-y (I want to avoid that)

**DM or comment if interested.** I'll send a signup link within 24 hours.

## Best Practices for Posting

### Timing
- **Best times:**
  - Weekday mornings: 7-9 AM EST (people scrolling before work)
  - Weekday evenings: 6-8 PM EST (people scrolling after work)
  - Sunday afternoons: 2-5 PM EST (weekend browsing)
- Avoid Friday/Saturday nights (low engagement)

### Engagement Strategy
- Respond to every comment within 1-2 hours (shows you're active)
- Be genuine and conversational (not salesy)
- If someone asks a question, answer publicly (helps others with same question)
- If you get pushback, stay humble: "That's fair feedback, I'm still learning"

### Follow-Up DM Template

## Tracking Beta Testers

Create a simple spreadsheet to track:
- Reddit username
- Email used for signup
- Date invited
- Date signed up
- Last active (check via app analytics)
- Feedback received (Y/N)
- Testimonial received (Y/N)

This helps you follow up with inactive testers and prioritize feedback interviews.

## Contingency: If Reddit Posts Get Removed

Some subreddits ban self-promotion. If your post gets removed:

1. **Read the rules carefully** - some subs allow it in specific threads (e.g., "Self-Promotion Saturday")
2. **Message the mods** - explain you're looking for genuine feedback, not just promoting
3. **Reframe the post** - focus on asking for advice rather than offering a product:
   - "I built a habit-based eating program and got feedback from 2 users. What would make you actually use something like this long-term?"
4. **Use Facebook groups instead** - often more permissive for beta testing requests
5. **Try niche Discord servers** - fitness/nutrition communities on Discord are usually beta-testing-friendly
